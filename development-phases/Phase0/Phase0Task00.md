## Initial Task for Phase 0:

### 0.0. Establish Core Governance, Comprehensive Workflow Documentation (Including Security Protocols, SDL Charter, Detailed Dual-Mode Implementation Strategy) & Phase 0 Progress Log:

### Action:

Create and/or update the docs/PROJECT_GOVERNANCE_AND_WORKFLOWS.md document. This document will define and expand upon the following sections:

- "Process Rigor Charter": This section will mandate specific review stages for all code, design documents, and architectural changes. It will define documentation standards (templates, level of detail), establish comprehensive Pull Request (PR) checklists that explicitly verify adherence to all First Principles (A-R), and outline a formal protocol for any necessary deviations from established processes, requiring explicit approval and justification.
- "Security Development Lifecycle (SDL) Charter for MVE": This will outline mandatory security activities for each development phase. Activities include: iterative threat modeling sessions at the start of new feature development and for major architectural components; mandatory security-focused peer code reviews for all critical code paths (especially those handling authentication, authorization, cryptography, financial transactions, on-chain state changes, and FFI boundaries); specification of security testing types (SAST using tools like cargo audit and clippy -- -W clippy::pedantic for Rust, cppcheck and compiler warnings for C++, DAST for APIs using tools like OWASP ZAP stubs, Fuzz Testing for FFI and input parsers using cargo-fuzz and custom harnesses) and their integration points into CI/CD pipelines; and a foundational plan for incident response, including vulnerability disclosure handling. This SDL will explicitly detail how security considerations apply to both the active MVE features and the pre-built, disabled on-chain features (e.g., ensuring disabled crypto code paths do not introduce vulnerabilities, secure management of configuration flags, review of attack surface if flags are toggled).
- "First Principles Implementation Guide": This section will provide concrete examples and guidelines on how each of the 18 First Principles (A-R), with a strong emphasis on Principle R ("Secure by Design"), translates into daily development tasks, influences decision-making processes (e.g., requiring security trade-offs to be explicitly documented and justified in ADRs), and forms part of PR review checklists. A standardized PR template will be created, including a mandatory "Security Implications Assessed" section requiring developers to outline potential security impacts of their changes.
- "Mode Off-Chain First, Mode On-Chain Pre-Built Strategy": This critical section will detail the comprehensive architectural and development strategy for building the MVE. It will specify:
  - Configuration Management: How enable_crypto and show_crypto (and potentially other granular flags) are defined, securely managed (e.g., via a secrets management solution for the cloud-ready build, secure local config for client), and propagated through the system.
  - Schema Design: Guidelines for Protocol Buffer and internal Rust struct definitions to include fields necessary for on-chain features (e.g., NTC staking status, crypto addresses, transaction hashes) but mark them as optional or provide clear documentation that they are inactive in the MVE. Define default values for these fields when enable_crypto is false.
  - API Design (gRPC/OpenAPI/FFI): How APIs will handle requests related to on-chain features when in Mode Off-Chain (e.g., returning specific "Feature Not Enabled" gRPC status codes or HTTP error codes). Ensure API contracts are designed to be extensible for on-chain features without breaking changes.
  - Service Logic: Patterns for conditional logic within Rust services and the Rust client application logic, based on enable_crypto flags, to enable/disable specific functionalities or code paths.
  - UI (QML): How QML components related to on-chain features will be conditionally rendered or hidden based on the show_crypto flag (managed by the Rust client application logic).
  - Testing: Strategies for testing both MVE functionality thoroughly and for verifying that on-chain features remain correctly disabled and do not interfere with MVE operations. Include stubs for future on-chain component testing.
- "Architecture Decision Record (ADR) Process": Define the process for creating, peer-reviewing (including mandatory security and mode-compatibility reviews by designated leads), approving, and versioning ADRs. ADRs must document significant architectural choices, their rationale, trade-offs, and implications for security and the dual-mode strategy.
- "Dependency Management Protocol": Detail the process for proposing, vetting (security, license, maintenance, necessity as per Principle A), approving, and updating DEPENDENCIES.md and COMPATIBILITY_MATRIX.md.
- "Internal Vulnerability Reporting & Triage Process": Establish a clear, confidential internal process for team members to report suspected security vulnerabilities, with defined steps for triage, severity assessment, and remediation tracking by the Security Lead.

### Create initial, empty versions of the following root-level documents, including template structures:

- DEPENDENCIES.md: Template columns: Dependency Name, Version (Pinned), License (SPDX Identifier), Component(s) Using It, Justification for Use, Security Assessment Summary (Date, Tool, Result, Link to CVEs/Audit Report), Approved By.
- COMPATIBILITY_MATRIX.md: Template sections for: protoc vs. tonic/prost vs. C++ grpc::, llama.cpp (Git commit SHA) vs. Rust NAR FFI Wrapper, OpenSSL (C++ vs. Rust openssl-sys), Key Rust Crates (Tokio, Serde, etc.) vs. Rustc Version.
- docs/TESTING_STRATEGY.md: Outline test types (Unit, Integration, E2E, Performance, Security (SAST, DAST, Fuzz), User Acceptance), tools, responsibilities, and environments for each phase. Explicitly detail methodologies for testing MVE features and for verifying the disabled state of on-chain components.
- docs/SMART_STUBS_SPECIFICATION.md: This document will define the standard contract for "smart stubs" used in Phase 0 development and testing. It will specify: core capabilities (simulating API responses, configurable latency/errors), standard behavioral interfaces, configuration parameters (including how they respond to enable_crypto: false/true to simulate dual-mode behavior, such as returning different error codes or payload structures), expected logging output (structured JSON), and versioning strategy for the stubs themselves.
- docs/INCIDENT_RESPONSE_PLAN_DRAFT.md: This initial draft will outline key sections: Roles and Responsibilities, Incident Severity Classification, Reporting Procedures, Containment Steps, Eradication, Recovery, Post-Incident Analysis, and Communication Plan (internal and external). It should consider incidents relevant to both MVE operations and potential issues arising from the pre-built on-chain components (e.g., accidental activation, configuration errors).

### Create the primary progress logging file: docs/progress_logs/progress_phase_0.md. This Markdown file will have a strictly enforced structure for each logged sub-task/activity:

- Timestamp: (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC)
- Sub-task/Activity: (e.g., "0.0.b: Defined Process Rigor Charter in PROJECT_GOVERNANCE_AND_WORKFLOWS.md")
- Files Modified/Created: (List of files with links to commits if possible)
- Rationale for Changes/Approach: (Detailed explanation, including security trade-offs considered and justification for dual-mode design decisions made)
- Current Utility: (How this change/document is used now)
- Future Implications/Utility: (How this supports subsequent phases or future on-chain feature activation)
- Blockers/Issues Encountered & Resolution: (Detailed account of any problems and how they were solved)
- Decisions Made: (Record of specific decisions, e.g., "Decided to use gRPC for Marketplace Service API for consistency")
- Adherence to First Principles (A-R): (Explicitly list each relevant First Principle and provide a concise justification of how this task adhered to it. For Principle R, detail specific security measures taken or design choices made for security.)
- ReviewedBy: (@GitHubHandle of Lead Architect, Project Manager, Security Lead, and other relevant leads)
- ReviewOutcome: (Approved / Approved with Conditions / Rejected - with link to review discussion)
- ValidationMethod: (How the completion and correctness of this task were validated, e.g., "Document peer review completed," "Team consensus achieved in meeting YYYY-MM-DD.")

**Mandate:** Updating the progress_phase_0.md log is a non-negotiable part of the "Definition of Done" for every subsequent sub-task within Phase 0. No sub-task is considered complete until its corresponding entry in the progress log is fully populated, reviewed, and validated.

Update docs/progress_logs/progress_phase_0.md: Log the creation of PROJECT_GOVERNANCE_AND_WORKFLOWS.md, DEPENDENCIES.md (template), COMPATIBILITY_MATRIX.md (template), docs/TESTING_STRATEGY.md (outline), docs/SMART_STUBS_SPECIFICATION.md (outline), docs/INCIDENT_RESPONSE_PLAN_DRAFT.md (outline), and docs/progress_logs/progress_phase_0.md itself. Specifically note the integration of the dual-mode strategy and the defined structure for progress logging.

- ReviewedBy: Lead Architect, Project Manager, Security Lead.
- ReviewOutcome: Approved.
- ValidationMethod: Peer review of the created document structures and outlines. Team consensus on the governance processes and the comprehensive nature of the progress log requirements.
- Git Commit: "Phase 0.0: Initialized Phase 0 Progress Log & Core Governance/Specification/Security Planning Docs (Dual-Mode Strategy, Detailed Logging Structure Integrated)."

### Design Rationale

Codifying these processes upfront is a high-leverage activity. It forces difficult conversations about standards and security early, preventing costly debates and refactoring later. The meticulous progress log enforces a culture of accountability and documentation from day one. The "Mode" strategy explicitly decouples the MVE launch readiness from the longer-term decentralization goals, allowing for a faster, more focused path to market without sacrificing the on-chain vision.

### Operational Considerations

These documents will be living but stable. Changes will require a formal ADR process. They will be the primary onboarding resource for all new team members. The entire governance structure is designed to function within a small, agile team, yet be robust enough to scale.

### Verification & Validation Criteria

The documents are peer-reviewed for clarity and completeness. All founding team members formally sign off on the governance processes in the kickoff meeting. The progress_phase_0.md log is updated to reflect the completion of this task.

### Testing Methodologies

N/A (Document review).

### Version Control Strategy

All documents created and committed to the main branch. A develop branch is created from main, and all future work will be done on feature branches off of develop.

### Security Audit & Compliance Checkpoints

The Security Lead must review and approve the SDL Charter and the Internal Vulnerability Reporting process. This is a mandatory sign-off for the completion of this task.
