# BUNKERVERSE Platform Artifacts Directory

**Purpose**: Centralized storage for all testing, validation, and documentation artifacts generated during development and testing phases.

**Structure Overview**:
```
artifacts/
├── logs/              # Execution logs and debug information
├── reports/           # Test reports and validation summaries  
├── test-results/      # Automated test outputs and results
├── performance/       # Performance benchmarks and metrics
├── security/          # Security scan results and vulnerability reports
└── README.md         # This documentation file
```

## Directory Descriptions

### `/logs/`
- **Purpose**: Runtime logs from PoC executions, service startups, and debugging information
- **Retention**: 30 days for debugging purposes
- **File Naming**: `{service}_{timestamp}.log`

### `/reports/`
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive reports from PoC validations, aggregated test results, and milestone documentation
- **Retention**: Permanent (archived quarterly)
- **File Naming**: `{report-type}_{date}_{version}.{format}`

### `/test-results/`
- **Purpose**: Raw test outputs, unit test results, integration test data, and coverage reports
- **Retention**: 90 days for trend analysis
- **File Naming**: `{test-suite}_{timestamp}_{result}.{format}`

### `/performance/`
- **Purpose**: Performance benchmarks, load test results, profiling data, and optimization metrics
- **Retention**: Permanent (for performance trend analysis)
- **File Naming**: `{component}_{test-type}_{timestamp}.{format}`

### `/security/`
- **Purpose**: Security scan results, vulnerability assessments, penetration test reports, and compliance audits
- **Retention**: Permanent (compliance requirement)
- **File Naming**: `{scan-type}_{component}_{timestamp}.{format}`

## Usage Guidelines

### For Developers
1. **Automated Generation**: Most artifacts are generated automatically by CI/CD pipelines and test scripts
2. **Manual Reports**: Place manually generated reports in the appropriate subdirectory with descriptive naming
3. **Log Analysis**: Use logs for debugging and troubleshooting during development

### For Testing Teams
1. **Test Results**: All automated test results are automatically stored in `/test-results/`
2. **Performance Baselines**: Establish and maintain performance baselines in `/performance/`
3. **Regression Analysis**: Compare current results against historical data for regression detection

### For Security Teams
1. **Scan Reports**: All security scanning results are automatically stored in `/security/`
2. **Compliance**: Security artifacts support SOC2, ISO27001, and other compliance requirements
3. **Incident Response**: Historical security data assists in incident investigation and response

## File Formats

### Supported Formats
- **Logs**: `.log`, `.txt` (plain text for parsing)
- **Reports**: `.md`, `.html`, `.pdf` (markdown preferred for version control)
- **Data**: `.json`, `.csv`, `.xml` (structured data)
- **Archives**: `.tar.gz`, `.zip` (for large datasets)

### Naming Conventions
- Use lowercase with hyphens for readability
- Include timestamps in ISO format (YYYYMMDD or YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS)
- Include version numbers for iterative reports
- Use descriptive prefixes for categorization

## Automation Integration

### CI/CD Pipeline Integration
```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions integration
- name: Store Test Artifacts
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
  with:
    name: test-results-${{ github.run_id }}
    path: artifacts/test-results/
    retention-days: 90
```

### Log Rotation
- Automated log rotation prevents disk space issues
- Old logs are compressed and archived
- Critical logs are backed up to external storage

### Report Generation
- Automated report generation triggers on milestone completion
- Performance reports generated weekly
- Security reports generated on every scan

## Access Control

### Read Access
- **Developers**: All directories for debugging and analysis
- **QA Teams**: `/test-results/`, `/performance/`, `/reports/`
- **Security Teams**: All directories with emphasis on `/security/`
- **Management**: `/reports/` and summary dashboards

### Write Access
- **CI/CD Systems**: All directories for automated artifact generation
- **Developers**: Manual reports and debugging artifacts only
- **Security Tools**: `/security/` directory for scan results
- **Test Automation**: `/test-results/` and `/performance/`

## Maintenance

### Regular Cleanup
- Automated cleanup of expired artifacts based on retention policies
- Monthly review of artifact sizes and storage usage
- Quarterly archival of permanent artifacts to long-term storage

### Monitoring
- Disk space monitoring with alerts at 80% capacity
- Automated reporting on artifact generation success/failure
- Regular validation of backup and archival processes

## Integration Examples

### PoC Execution Artifacts
```powershell
# Example: Running PoC with artifact collection
.\run_all_pocs.ps1 -GenerateReport
# Generates: artifacts/reports/poc_execution_report_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.txt
```

### Performance Testing
```bash
# Example: Performance test with artifact storage
cargo test --release -- --test-threads=1 > artifacts/performance/cargo_bench_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).txt
```

### Security Scanning
```bash
# Example: Security scan with artifact storage
cargo audit --json > artifacts/security/cargo_audit_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).json
```

## Best Practices

1. **Consistent Naming**: Follow established naming conventions for easy discovery
2. **Structured Data**: Use JSON/CSV for data that needs programmatic analysis
3. **Documentation**: Include metadata and context for complex artifacts
4. **Compression**: Compress large artifacts to save space
5. **Validation**: Verify artifact integrity before archival
