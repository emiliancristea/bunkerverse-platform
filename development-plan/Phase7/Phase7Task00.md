Initial Task for Phase 7:
* (7.0) Create Phase 7 Progress Log & Review Phase 6 Deliverables / Phase 7 DoR Verification
(Security, Stability & External Readiness Focus for MVE)
Technical Reference
o docs/progress_logs/progress_phase_6.md
o Phase 6 Deliverable documentation
o Finalized v0.9.9-stable build artifacts and installers (from Task 6.2)
Context/Problem Statement
Phase 6 produced a production-ready, internally validated MVE and a formal "Go" decision to proceed with external testing. Before onboarding the first external user, we must conduct a final readiness check. This task involves creating the official progress log for Phase 7 and holding a kickoff meeting to formally review all P6 deliverables and verify that all necessary materials, feedback channels, and support processes are in place and ready for the external cohort.
Measurable Objectives
o A docs/progress_logs/progress_phase_7.md file is created.
o A Phase 7 kickoff meeting is successfully conducted and its minutes are documented.
o All P6 deliverables are formally reviewed and signed off against the P7 "Definition of Ready" checklist.
o A formal "Phase 7 Initiated" outcome is declared and logged.
Implementation Guidance
Action:
o Create docs/progress_logs/progress_phase_7.md with the same detailed structure, emphasizing external feedback analysis, bug triage from testers, and NAR narrative validation on diverse hardware.
o Conduct a Phase 7 kickoff meeting. Formally review all Phase 6 deliverables (highly stable, polished, performance-tuned MVE; finalized UI/UX; validated backend performance; production-grade monitoring/backup/security hardening completed; all internal acceptance tests passed).
o Verify Phase 7 "Definition of Ready" (DoR) criteria are met:
* The local Docker Compose simulation staging environment is stable and configured identically to the planned production environment, with all security measures active.
* The final MVE candidate client installers (from P6.2) are available and internally validated.
* Tester onboarding materials (guides, FAQs, starter asset plans) are finalized and have undergone legal review.
* Feedback channels (private Discord, dedicated bug tracker project) are established and staffed.
* A clear incident response plan for handling issues on the staging environment during the closed test is documented and understood by the SRE/DevOps team.
o Review PROJECT_GOVERNANCE_AND_WORKFLOWS.MD for SDL activities specific to handling external tester feedback and, most importantly, the process for securely handling externally reported potential security vulnerabilities.
Update docs/progress_logs/progress_phase_7.md: Log the creation of this file, the kickoff, and formal confirmation of P7 readiness. Explicitly document the final internal sign-off on the stability and security posture of the staging environment before exposing it to external users.
Design Rationale
This final checkpoint before external exposure is a critical risk management step. It ensures the testing environment is pristine, the onboarding materials are clear, and the team is fully prepared to handle the influx of feedback and potential issue reports. This structured start is essential for running an efficient and effective closed testing phase.
Operational Considerations
The "staging environment" for this external test will be the fully-featured MVE stack running within the local Docker Compose simulation on the designated host machine. This machine will need to have its ports correctly forwarded and secured to allow external testers to connect to the various service endpoints. The stability and performance of this single host machine will be a key factor during the test.
Verification & Validation Criteria
o Kickoff Meeting Minutes are recorded and approved.
o The Phase 6 Deliverable Checklist is formally signed-off against the P7 DoR criteria.
o All external testing materials and channels are confirmed to be ready and staffed.
Testing Methodologies
N/A (Process verification).
Version Control Strategy
o Branching: The progress_phase_7.md file is created on a feature/phase-7-setup branch.
o Commits: The Git Commit message for this task will be exactly as specified.
Security Audit & Compliance Checkpoints
o The Security Lead must formally sign off on the readiness of the staging environment and the secure process for handling externally reported vulnerabilities before the test can begin.
ReviewedBy: Project Manager, Lead Architect, All Tech Leads, QA Lead, SRE/DevOps Lead, Community Lead, Legal Counsel, Security Lead.
ReviewOutcome: Phase 7 (External Closed Testing) Initiated.
ValidationMethod: Kickoff Meeting Minutes recorded. P6 Deliverables Verified against acceptance criteria. P7 DoR Checklist Confirmed.
