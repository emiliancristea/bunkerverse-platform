Task 7.7: Final Legal, Documentation & Community Preparation for Public Launch
(Post-External Feedback - Principle R)
Technical Reference
* Finalized v1.0.0 build (from Task 7.6)
* docs/public/KNOWN_ISSUES_V1.0.0.md
* All existing support and legal documentation drafts.
Context/Problem Statement
The technical product (v1.0.0) is complete and approved for launch. However, a successful launch requires more than just functional code. All public-facing materials-including legal documents, support guides, and community announcements-must be finalized, reviewed, and updated with the learnings from the external test. The community and support teams must be fully briefed and prepared for the influx of new users. This task covers this final, critical layer of non-technical preparation.
Measurable Objectives
* Final, legally-reviewed versions of the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy are published.
* A comprehensive public FAQ and knowledge base, updated with findings from the closed test, is published.
* The community moderation and support team is fully briefed and confirms its readiness for launch day.
* A finalized and timed launch day communications plan is approved.
Implementation Guidance
Action: Ensure all legal text, public-facing documentation, and community support materials are finalized, reviewed, incorporate learnings from external testing, and are ready for public consumption at launch.
* Implementation Details:
o Terms of Service & Privacy Policy:
* Conduct a final legal review to ensure they accurately reflect the launched product's features, data handling (including zkLogin and local NAR), and the on-chain nature of the MVE.
* Ensure links in the client installer and on the website point to these final versions.
o Public FAQ & Support Documentation:
* Finalize and publish all public FAQ and knowledge base articles to the production support website.
* These must be updated to include common questions and issues encountered during the external closed testing (e.g., specific NAR performance issues on certain hardware, common zkLogin provider quirks).
o Developer Documentation (ROADMAP.md):
* Ensure the public-facing ROADMAP.md in the repository accurately reflects the state of the launched MVE v1.0.0 and clearly delineates post-launch features (like the UE5 Game MVPs).
o Community Moderation & Support Team Readiness:
* Conduct a final briefing for all community and support staff on the MVE v1.0.0 release.
* Review the final Known Issues list, the FAQs, support procedures, escalation paths for launch day issues, and the on-call schedule.
* Finalize the exact wording and timing of all launch day community announcements.
* Update docs/progress_logs/progress_phase_7.md:
* Log the final review and sign-off dates for all legal documents, public FAQs, and support materials.
* Confirm the final community team readiness session has been conducted.
Design Rationale
Thorough preparation of public-facing materials is crucial for a smooth launch. A comprehensive FAQ, informed by real user feedback from the closed test, can significantly reduce the load on the support team. Clear legal documents protect the project and the users. A well-briefed support team can handle the initial influx of users efficiently and professionally, creating a positive first impression for the entire community.
Operational Considerations
The public FAQ and support documentation will become the first line of defense for the community support team. The finalized launch day communications plan will be the script that the marketing and community teams execute precisely during the launch sequence in Phase 8.
Verification & Validation Criteria
* Formal sign-off from Legal Counsel on the final ToS and Privacy Policy.
* Formal sign-off from the Community Management and Marketing Leads on all public-facing documentation and the launch day communications plan.
* The support team readiness session is successfully conducted.
Testing Methodologies
N/A (Documentation and process finalization).
Version Control Strategy
* Branching: Any final changes to documentation (like ROADMAP.md) or links within the client source code will be committed to the release/mve-v1.0.0 branch.
* Commits: The Git Commit message for this task will be exactly as specified.
Security Audit & Compliance Checkpoints
* The Security Lead will perform a final review of the public support documentation to ensure it does not inadvertently disclose any sensitive information about the system's architecture or security procedures.
* The final legal review is a critical compliance checkpoint.
ReviewedBy: Legal Counsel, Marketing Lead, Community Management Lead, Technical Writer.
ReviewOutcome: All Public-Facing Documentation, Legal Texts, and Community Support Plans Finalized and Approved for Launch.
ValidationMethod: Formal sign-off from each respective lead. The launch day communications plan is finalized and ready for execution.
