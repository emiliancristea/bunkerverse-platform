Task 7.6: Final MVE Launch Candidate Build Preparation & Stakeholder Sign-off
(Post-External Testing & Final Fixes - Principles A-R)
Technical Reference
* Staging and Production CI/CD Pipelines
* All E2E Test Plans
* Project Issue Tracker
* docs/INCIDENT_RESPONSE_PLAN_DRAFT.md
Context/Problem Statement
The external closed testing phase is complete, and all critical (P0/P1) feedback has been addressed through iterative hotfixes. The project has incorporated invaluable real-world learnings and is now at its peak stability and polish. This task is the final, formal process for preparing the definitive "MVE Launch Candidate" build (v1.0.0). It involves a hard feature freeze, a final internal regression test, and a critical Go/No-Go readiness review with all stakeholders to provide the final approval for a public launch.
Measurable Objectives
* A final release/mve-v1.0.0 branch is created and a final, production-signed build is successfully generated.
* The v1.0.0 build passes a final, exhaustive "Gold" internal regression test with no new P0 bugs discovered.
* A final "Known Issues" document for the public launch is finalized and approved.
* A formal MVE Launch Go/No-Go Readiness Review meeting is successfully conducted, resulting in a documented "Go" or "No-Go" decision.
Implementation Guidance
Action: After sufficient external closed testing cycles and the resolution of all identified P0/P1 bugs, prepare a final "MVE Launch Candidate" build. This build incorporates all learnings and fixes from both internal and external testing and represents the exact version that will go to public launch if approved.
* Process Details:
o Feature Freeze & Final Bug Triage: Formally declare the end of the external testing phase and enforce a hard feature freeze. Review any remaining P1 bugs and decide if they are critical enough to block the launch or if they can be moved to the known issues list. No P0 bugs should remain.
o Release Branching & Build (release/mve-v1.0.0):
* Create a final release branch (e.g., release/mve-v1.0.0) from the stable, externally-validated staging branch.
* Execute the finalized production CI/CD pipeline to build all Rust backend artifacts and the C++ Control Center Client installers. This build will use production settings and will be fully signed and notarized.
o Final Internal "Gold" Regression Testing:
* Deploy this exact v1.0.0 build to a clean staging environment (running in the local Docker Compose simulation).
* The internal QA team and dev leads will perform one last, exhaustive regression test run, covering all major E2E scenarios, performance checks, security checks, and spot-checks of narrative quality.
o Generate & Verify Final Production Checksums: Generate SHA256 checksums for all final client installers and server artifacts and document them.
o Final Known Issues Document for Public Launch: Update and finalize docs/public/KNOWN_ISSUES_V1.0.0.md based on any remaining, accepted P2/P3 bugs from all testing phases.
o MVE Launch Go/No-Go Readiness Review & Sign-off Meeting (Critical Final Decision):
* Attendees: All key stakeholders (PM, Architect, All Leads, QA, SRE, Community, Marketing, Legal, Security).
* Agenda:
* Review a summary of the entire external closed testing phase.
* Review the results of the final internal "Gold" regression test on the v1.0.0 candidate build.
* Review the final performance metrics against MVE targets.
* Review the final Rust NAR narrative quality assessment.
* Review the final Known Issues List.
* Review the production deployment plan (from Phase 8) and the rollback procedure.
* Review the community support and communication plan for launch day.
* QA Lead provides formal sign-off on MVE Launch Candidate quality.
* Security Lead provides formal sign-off on MVE Launch Candidate security posture.
* Formal Go/No-Go vote by stakeholders for proceeding to public launch (Phase 8).
* Update docs/progress_logs/progress_phase_7.md:
a. Log the creation of the final release branch and the v1.0.0 build tag.
b. Document the results of the final "Gold" internal regression test and the QA/Security sign-offs.
c. Link to the final known issues list and checksums document.
d. Record detailed minutes, attendees, and the formal Go/No-Go decision from the Launch Readiness Review meeting.
Design Rationale
This highly structured, formal process is the ultimate quality and risk management gate before a public launch. The "Gold" regression test ensures that the final build process itself didn't introduce any new issues. The Go/No-Go meeting forces all stakeholders to confront the final state of the product, including its known flaws (the Known Issues List), and make a collective, accountable decision. This prevents a launch that the team is not fully confident in.
Operational Considerations
The v1.0.0 build artifacts generated in this task are the exact files that will be deployed to production in Phase 8 if a "Go" decision is made. They must be securely stored and their checksums preserved to ensure integrity. The Known Issues document is a critical tool for the community support team to effectively manage user expectations on launch day.
Verification & Validation Criteria
1. Successful completion of the final internal regression test with no new P0 bugs.
2. Formal, documented sign-off from all required stakeholders (especially QA and Security) in the Launch Readiness Review meeting.
3. A clear "Go" or "No-Go" decision is recorded.
Testing Methodologies
* Regression Testing: A full, exhaustive execution of all E2E test cases on the final release candidate build.
* Acceptance Testing: The formal review and sign-off by all stakeholders serves as the final internal acceptance test.
Version Control Strategy
1. Branching: A release/mve-v1.0.0 branch is created from the stable staging branch. No new features are allowed on this branch; only P0 blocker fixes discovered during the "Gold" test.
2. Tagging & Commits: Tag the release branch with the final MVE version (e.g., v1.0.0). Commit the final checksums and known issues documents.
Security Audit & Compliance Checkpoints
* The Security Lead's formal sign-off on the v1.0.0 build's security posture is a mandatory, non-negotiable condition for a "Go" decision. This represents the final internal security approval before public release.
ReviewedBy: All Stakeholders for Launch.
ReviewOutcome: MVE Launch Candidate Build v1.0.0 Approved for Public Release (or a No-Go decision with clear reasons).
ValidationMethod: Successful completion of the final internal regression test. Formal, documented sign-off from all required stakeholders in the Launch Readiness Review meeting.
