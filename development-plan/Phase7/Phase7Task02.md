Task 7.2: Feedback Channel Management & Organized Tester Bug Reporting
(Live External Feedback - Principles O, P, R)
Technical Reference
* Bug Tracker (Jira, Trello, etc.) and Discord Administration Guides
* Sentry (or equivalent crash reporting service) Documentation
* PGP for secure email communication
Context/Problem Statement
With external testers now onboarded, a flood of unstructured feedback, bug reports, and potential security concerns is imminent. Without a structured, managed, and responsive process for handling this influx, valuable information will be lost, testers will become disengaged, and critical issues may be overlooked. This task focuses on actively managing all designated feedback channels, enforcing a structured reporting process, and establishing a clear triage and escalation path for all incoming intelligence.
Measurable Objectives
* All designated feedback channels (private Discord, bug tracker) are actively monitored, with a target response time of <12 hours for all new submissions.
* A mandatory, structured bug reporting template is successfully enforced in the bug tracker.
* A secure, private channel for reporting security vulnerabilities is operational and actively monitored by the Security Lead.
* A daily triage process is successfully established, resulting in the categorization and prioritization of all incoming reports.
Implementation Guidance
Action: Actively manage all designated feedback channels throughout the closed test period. Ensure external testers are effectively using the structured bug reporting process for functional, security, and narrative issues, enabling efficient triage and resolution.
* Implementation Details:
o Active Channel Monitoring & Engagement:
* A dedicated team of Community Managers, QA Analysts, and Developer Liaisons will continuously monitor the private Discord and the bug tracker.
* The team's primary responsibility is to ensure no tester feedback goes unacknowledged. They will respond promptly, professionally, and empathetically to all submissions.
* For complex issues, they will engage directly with the tester to gather more information (logs, videos, system specs) through private messages.
o Bug Reporting Template Enforcement & Guidance:
* The bug tracker will be configured with a mandatory template for all new issues, requiring fields for: Summary, Platform, Client Version, Reproduction Steps, Actual Result, Expected Result, Severity, and Attachments.
* The support team will guide testers to use this template correctly and assist with log collection.
o Automated Crash Reporting Triage (Sentry, etc.):
* The SRE/DevOps and Client teams will actively monitor the configured crash reporting service for the staging environment.
* They will analyze incoming crash reports from the diverse range of tester hardware, paying close attention to stack traces originating from the C++ Shell, the Rust Application Logic, the Rust NAR FFI boundary, or llama.cpp itself.
* Crashes will be correlated with manually reported bugs and prioritized for investigation.
o Secure Vulnerability Reporting Channel:
* A dedicated, private, and clearly documented channel for responsible disclosure of potential security vulnerabilities will be actively monitored by the Security Lead. This will be a specific email address (e.g., security-testing@bunkerverse.com) with a PGP key provided for encrypted communication.
* Testers will be explicitly instructed in the onboarding materials not to report security issues in public channels or the general bug tracker.
* All reports received through this channel will be acknowledged promptly and escalated immediately for investigation, following the defined incident response protocol.
o Feedback Categorization & Prioritization (External Focus):
* Conduct daily triage meetings with QA, Community, Product, and relevant Dev Leads.
* All incoming reports will be categorized: Bug (Functional, Security, Performance, Narrative/Text) or Feedback (UI/UX, Feature Request/Idea).
* Bugs will be prioritized based on severity and impact (P0-P3). This triage is critical for the iterative hotfixing process in Task 7.4.
o Daily External Feedback Summary: The QA and Community Leads will compile a concise daily summary report for the entire core team, highlighting the most critical new bugs, prevalent feedback themes, and the overall sentiment of the testers.
* Update docs/progress_logs/progress_phase_7.md:
o Log the continuous monitoring activities for all feedback channels.
o Detail the structure of the bug reporting template.
o Summarize the types and volume of feedback/bugs received on a weekly basis.
o Document the secure process for handling potential security vulnerability reports and confirm it is operational.
Design Rationale
A structured feedback process is essential for converting raw user feedback into actionable engineering tasks. Enforcing a bug template saves significant time in the triage process by ensuring all necessary information is provided upfront. A dedicated, secure channel for vulnerability reporting is an industry best practice that protects the project by allowing security researchers to disclose issues responsibly without making them public before a fix is available.
Operational Considerations
This task is heavily process- and people-oriented. It requires dedicated personnel to monitor channels and engage with testers. The daily triage meeting is a critical operational sync that will drive the development priorities for the remainder of the closed testing period.
Verification & Validation Criteria
* A consistent flow of structured bug reports and qualitative feedback is being received and triaged daily.
* The team can successfully retrieve and analyze client logs and crash reports associated with bug tickets.
* Any security concerns raised by testers are shown to be promptly and privately escalated to the Security Lead via the secure channel.
Testing Methodologies
N/A (Process execution and validation).
Version Control Strategy
* Branching: N/A (Process-oriented task).
* Commits: The Git Commit message for this task will be exactly as specified.
Security Audit & Compliance Checkpoints
* The Security Lead must confirm that the secure vulnerability reporting channel is operational and that all testers have been properly briefed on its use.
* The process for handling and escalating these reports must be reviewed and approved.
ReviewedBy: QA Lead, Community Manager, Product Owner, Security Lead, SRE/DevOps Lead.
ReviewOutcome: External Tester Feedback Channels Operational and Effectively Utilized, with a Secure Vulnerability Reporting Path.
ValidationMethod: A consistent flow of structured bug reports and qualitative feedback is being received and triaged. The team can successfully retrieve and analyze client logs and crash reports. Any security concerns raised by testers are shown to be promptly and privately escalated to the Security Lead.
