Task 3.0: Create Phase 3 Progress Log & Review Phase 2 Deliverables / Phase 3 DoR Verification
(Security, UI/UX & Platform Feature Focus for MVE)
Technical Reference
a. docs/progress_logs/progress_phase_2.md
b. Phase 2 Deliverable documentation
c. Game Design Documents (GDDs) for all core platform features (Marketplace, Forums, etc.)
d. docs/PROJECT_GOVERNANCE_AND_WORKFLOWS.md (SDL Charter)

Library/Tool Versions:
| Library/Tool | Version | Notes |
|--------------|---------|-------|
| Qt SDK | 6.9.2 (MSVC 2022 64-bit) | Path: D:\DOCUMENTS\Qt\6.9.2\msvc2022_64 |
| cxx-qt Crate | 0.7.2 | The crate aims to support all Qt 6 versions; pinned for stability. |
| rustc | 1.80.0 (Stable) | Pinned via rust-toolchain.toml. |
Context/Problem Statement
Phase 2 delivered a live backend with functional on-chain logic and a live data pipeline. We now pivot to building the full, rich client platform experience that was defined in the project's scope. This is a massive implementation effort. A formal kickoff is essential to ensure all Phase 2 components are stable and that the GDDs and UI/UX designs for the full platform feature set are finalized, understood, and ready for secure implementation.
Measurable Objectives
o A docs/progress_logs/progress_phase_3.md file is created with the correct structure.
o A Phase 3 kickoff meeting is successfully conducted and its minutes are documented.
o All P2 deliverables are formally reviewed and signed off.
o The GDDs and UI definitions for all P3-scope platform features are formally signed off by all relevant leads.
o A formal "Phase 3 Initiated" outcome is declared and logged.
Implementation Guidance
Action:
a. Create docs/progress_logs/progress_phase_3.md with the same detailed structure, emphasizing UI/UX implementation, client-backend integration security, and the accuracy of data flow from the live Indexer to the final UI components.
b. Conduct a Phase 3 kickoff meeting. Formally review all Phase 2 deliverables (functional L3 Smart Contracts for P2-scope logic; functional Rust Indexer ingesting/querying live P2 data; Rust NAR with basic contextual narratives; functional C++ CC Marketplace/Social UI stubs interacting with the live backend).
c. Verify that the "Definition of Ready" for Phase 3 tasks is met. This must include:
Stable Rust Indexer/Service APIs v0.1 (from P1, now proven with P2 live data).
Finalized and signed-off Game Design Documents (GDDs) for all platform MVE features. These GDDs must detail:
All specific L3 Smart Contract events to be triggered by platform actions (e.g., creating a forum post that earns a reward, listing an item on the marketplace).
The rules and mechanics for the CAMP (events), ARCADE (HTML5 games), and ARCHIVES (forums) sections.
The full functionality of the unified MARKETPLACE.
The logic for the SOCIAL interface (chat, friends, etc.).
All NAR narrative trigger points and the contextual data required from the platform state.
d. Review PROJECT_GOVERNANCE_AND_WORKFLOWS.MD for SDL activities specific to Phase 3 (e.g., mandatory security code reviews for new backend services, threat modeling for client-to-backend communication, secure validation of user-generated content in forums/chat).
Update docs/progress_logs/progress_phase_3.md: Log the creation of this file, the kickoff meeting, and formal confirmation of Phase 3 readiness. Explicitly confirm that the GDDs for all platform features are signed off and align with the backend's capabilities.
Design Rationale
This formal kickoff is a critical project management gate. Building the full client platform is a major undertaking. Ensuring that the GDDs and designs that define this platform are perfect and that the security plan is robust before writing the code is paramount to prevent costly rework and deliver a high-quality, cohesive product.
Operational Considerations
The GDDs signed off on in this task become the canonical specification for all P3-scope platform functionality. All subsequent development and QA work in this phase will be measured against these documents.
Verification & Validation Criteria
o Kickoff Meeting Minutes recorded.
o The Phase 2 Deliverable Checklist is formally signed off.
o The Phase 3 DoR Checklist, including sign-off on all platform GDDs, is verified and signed off.
Testing Methodologies
N/A (Process verification).
Version Control Strategy
a. Branching: The progress_phase_3.md file is created on a feature/phase-3-setup branch.
b. Commits: The Git Commit message for this task will be exactly as specified.
Security Audit & Compliance Checkpoints
The Security Lead must formally sign off on the P3-scope GDDs, confirming they have reviewed the defined features for potential security exploits (e.g., user-generated content injection, economic flaws in the Arcade).
The Security Lead must approve the SDL plan for Phase 3.
ReviewedBy: Project Manager, Lead Architect, All Tech Leads (L3 Smart Contracts, Indexer, Client, etc.), Security Lead, QA Lead, Game Design Lead (mandatory for GDD verification).
ReviewOutcome: Phase 3 Initiated (Full Platform MVE Implementation Plan Confirmed).
ValidationMethod: Kickoff Meeting Minutes recorded. Phase 2 Deliverable Checklist formally signed-off. Phase 3 DoR Checklist verified and signed-off.
