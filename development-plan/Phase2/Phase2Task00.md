Initial Task for Phase 2:
(2.0) Create Phase 2 Progress Log & Review Phase 1 Deliverables / Phase 2 DoR Verification
(Security, Game Design & Canonical Rules Focus for MVE)
Technical Reference
o docs/progress_logs/progress_phase_1.md (as the source for the review)
o Phase 1 Deliverable documentation
o Game Design Documents (GDDs) for P2-scope mechanics
o docs/PROJECT_GOVERNANCE_AND_WORKFLOWS.md (SDL Charter)
Context/Problem Statement
Phase 1 delivered a functional identity system and a live L3 testnet with placeholder contracts. We now transition to building the core on-chain logic that will govern the MVE. This is arguably the most security-critical phase of the project, as the smart contracts we build will become the immutable laws of our universe. A formal kickoff is essential to ensure all Phase 1 components are stable and that the Game Design Documents, which define these on-chain rules, are finalized, understood, and ready for secure implementation.
Measurable Objectives
A docs/progress_logs/progress_phase_2.md file is created with the correct structure.
A Phase 2 kickoff meeting is successfully conducted and its minutes are documented.
All P1 deliverables are formally reviewed and signed off.
The P2-scope GDDs are formally signed off by all relevant leads.
A formal "Phase 2 Initiated" outcome is declared and logged.
Implementation Guidance
Action:
o Create docs/progress_logs/progress_phase_2.md with the same detailed structure as previous logs, emphasizing canonical rule implementation, data flow validation, and security of state transitions.
o Conduct a Phase 2 kickoff meeting. Formally review all Phase 1 deliverables against their acceptance criteria (functional secure zkLogin with Rust Identity Service and Client; functional Arbitrum Orbit L3 Testnet; functional Rust Indexer API stubs; functional Rust NAR; functional CC Client HOMESCREEN).
o Confirm readiness to proceed based on the "Definition of Ready" for Phase 2 tasks, which must include:
Stable Rust Indexer/Service APIs v0.1 from P1.
Finalized and signed-off Game Design Documents (GDDs) detailing the P2-scope canonical rules:
How a UserRegistered event initializes a default ActiveBunkerguardDataProto.
How RobotLinked events trigger the same default state initialization.
Rules for P2-level RobotLevelledUp.
Rules for P2-level ReputationUpdated.
Specific, GDD-defined NftDetailsProto attributes for a representative set of NFTs that can be minted in P2.
Clear understanding of how to implement this logic securely within the L3 Smart Contracts.
o Review PROJECT_GOVERNANCE_AND_WORKFLOWS.MD focusing on SDL activities for Phase 2 (e.g., security code reviews for smart contract logic, updated threat models for on-chain transaction processing, prevention of economic exploits).
Update docs/progress_logs/progress_phase_2.md: Log the creation of this file, the kickoff meeting agenda and minutes, and formal confirmation of Phase 2 readiness based on the DoR checklist. Explicitly note the sign-off on P1 deliverables and the team's preparedness to implement the core L3 smart contract canonical logic.
Design Rationale
This formal kickoff is a critical security and project management gate. The on-chain logic being implemented in this phase is immutable once deployed (or difficult to change). Ensuring the GDDs that define this logic are perfect and that the security plan is robust before writing the code is paramount. It prevents the deployment of flawed, exploitable economic or game mechanics.
Operational Considerations
The GDDs signed off on in this task become the canonical specification for all P2-scope on-chain functionality. All subsequent development and QA work in this phase will be measured against these documents.
Verification & Validation Criteria
o Kickoff Meeting Minutes are recorded, approved, and linked in the progress log.
o The Phase 1 Deliverable Checklist is formally signed off.
o The Phase 2 DoR Checklist, including sign-off on the GDDs, is verified and signed off by all required leads.
Testing Methodologies
N/A (Process verification).
Version Control Strategy
o Branching: The progress_phase_2.md file is created on a feature/phase-2-setup branch.
o Commits: The Git Commit message for this task will be exactly as specified.
Security Audit & Compliance Checkpoints
The Security Lead must formally sign off on the P2-scope GDDs, confirming they have reviewed the defined rules for potential economic exploits.
The Security Lead must approve the SDL plan for Phase 2, including the specific tools and processes for smart contract security reviews.
ReviewedBy: Project Manager, Lead Architect, All Tech Leads (L3 Smart Contracts, Indexer, Client Rust/QML, etc.), Security Lead, QA Lead, Game Design Lead (mandatory for rules verification).
ReviewOutcome: Phase 2 Initiated (Full Class/Item System Schema Defaults from P0/P1 Ready for Live Logic Implementation in MVE).
ValidationMethod: Kickoff Meeting Minutes recorded. Phase 1 Deliverable Checklist formally signed-off. Phase 2 DoR Checklist verified and signed-off.
