Context/Problem Statement
With the completion of the full dynamic Bunkerguard progression system, the complete marketplace, and the monetization loop, all core economic and personalization features of the MVE are now implemented. This final task of Phase 4 is to conduct a comprehensive end-to-end (E2E) integration testing campaign. This is critical to validate the full data flow with all GDD-defined attributes, the security of all on-chain and off-chain transactions, and the consistency and quality of the deeply contextual narratives that are now driven by this live dynamic state.
Measurable Objectives
The full "Monetization-to-Dynamic-State-Change" user cycle is successfully validated.
The Bunkerguard dynamic progression system is proven to correctly assign all 12 BunkerClasses and 3 Affiliations based on GDD rules.
The full marketplace lifecycle, including auctions and rich filtering, is validated.
A suite of security E2E tests for common economic and progression exploits passes successfully.
Implementation Guidance
Action: Conduct the final, comprehensive E2E integration tests for all newly implemented economic and BUNKERGUARD personalization loops. This validates the full data flow with all GDD-defined attributes, the security of all transactions, and the consistency and quality of the deeply contextual narratives.
1. Key E2E Scenarios (Automated where feasible, else detailed manual scripts):
User purchases Credits via Stripe.
User buys a "Class Pack" from BUNKER CORP on the marketplace.
User equips the items from the pack, dynamically changing their BunkerClass to the pack's target class (e.g., "Pathfinder").
Verify every step: payment is successful, L3 Smart Contract state changes for balances and NFTs are correct, Indexer updates are timely, Guard UI correctly reflects the new items, stats, and class, and a specific NAR narrative is generated for each step.
Create test scripts/plans (using the Admin CLI to mint items) to equip GDD-defined item sets to achieve each of the 12 BunkerClasses and flip between Loyal/Corrupt/Neutral Affiliations.
Verify the Guard UI dynamically and correctly updates all stats, class, and affiliation.
Verify the specific Rust NAR narratives for each class/affiliation change.
Attempt to exploit the marketplace (e.g., price manipulation during a trade).
Attempt to exploit the Guard UI (e.g., equip an item to an invalid slot).
Attempt to exploit the payment flow (e.g., replay a Stripe webhook).
Verify the system's security controls at the L3 Smart Contracts and service layers prevent these exploits.
2. Update docs/progress_logs/progress_phase_4.md:
o Document E2E scenarios.
o Log outcomes, data validation, NAR output examples for all 12 classes.
o Detail security E2E test cases and their outcomes.
Design Rationale
This final, holistic integration test is the ultimate validation gate for the MVE's economic and progression systems. It moves beyond testing individual components and validates the complex, emergent behavior of the entire interconnected system. Successfully passing these scenarios provides the highest possible confidence in the stability, security, and data consistency of the core platform before moving on to the final phase of MVE development.
Operational Considerations
The automated test scripts developed for this task, especially the "BUNKERGUARD Full Progression Cycle," will form the core of a powerful regression suite. These scripts will be invaluable for ensuring that future changes to item GDDs or smart contracts do not have unintended consequences on the game's balance and economy. All testing is performed in the local Docker Compose simulation.
Verification & Validation Criteria
All P4 E2E tests pass.
The core economic and BUNKERGUARD loops are fully functional, secure, data-consistent, and accompanied by rich, dynamic NAR narratives.
The Security Lead formally signs off on the results of the security E2E tests.
Testing Methodologies
A combination of automated test scripts (using the Admin CLI and gRPC test harnesses) for backend validation and heavily scripted manual QA for the full client-to-backend user experience validation.
Version Control Strategy
Branching: The integration test suite and any necessary fixes are developed on a feature/p4-integration-tests branch.
Commits: The Git Commit message for this task will be exactly as specified.
Security Audit & Compliance Checkpoints
This task serves as the final security gate for the MVE's economic systems. The Security Lead must review and approve the outcomes of all security E2E tests. Any discovered exploits must be addressed before the phase can be considered complete.
ReviewedBy: QA Lead, All Tech Leads, Lead Architect, Product Owner, Game Design Lead, Security Lead.
ReviewOutcome: Approved for MVE Economic & Personalization Scope with Full Detail & Security Validation.
ValidationMethod: All P4 E2E tests pass. Core economic and BUNKERGUARD loops are fully functional, secure, data-consistent, and accompanied by rich, dynamic NAR.

Phase 4 Deliverable
(Security-Hardened Process-Hardened Foundation with Functional Secure Economic & Full Personalization Loops for MVE)
Description
Upon completion of Phase 4, the BUNKERVERSE MVE has a fully functional, secure, and deeply engaging economy and player personalization system, all operating in the MVE and powered by the live Rust backend and on-chain L3 logic.
1. Fully Dynamic On-Chain Logic (L3 Smart Contracts)
Description: The L3 Smart Contracts now implement the complete, GDD-defined logic for all MVE NFT types, the token economy (XP/Credits), and dynamic BUNKERGUARD progression. The contracts can calculate and store a player's stats, class (all 12 types), and affiliation based on their equipped items and reputation, and process all marketplace transactions (including auctions and pack sales) via secure, atomic functions.
Acceptance Criteria: The L3 Smart Contracts correctly enforce all canonical economic and character progression rules as defined in the GDD, validated through extensive testing.
2. Comprehensive Live Rust Indexer
Description: The Rust Indexer now comprehensively indexes all dynamic marketplace and BUNKERGUARD state, including listings with fully filterable attributes, live player stats, class, affiliation, and detailed equipped items. Its gRPC API provides performant, secure access to this rich, live data.
Acceptance Criteria: The Indexer accurately reflects the canonical L3 smart contract state in near real-time and supports all required advanced filtering and querying for the client UIs.
3. Functional Monetization Loop
Description: The Rust Payment Service is fully and securely integrated with Stripe, allowing users to purchase Credits. The L3 smart contracts' token ledger correctly and idempotently reflects these balance updates.
Acceptance Criteria: The end-to-end credit purchase flow is functional, secure, and validated in Stripe's test mode.
4. Deeply Contextual & Dynamic Rust NAR
Description: The Rust NAR now generates rich, highly specific narratives for the full range of Guard and Marketplace events, leveraging the live, dynamic context (class, affiliation, specific item names/stats/traits) from the Indexer.
Acceptance Criteria: Narrative quality for economic and personalization events is high, contextually accurate, and validated across all 12 BunkerClasses.
5. Fully Functional Guard & Marketplace Client UIs
Description: The C++ Control Center Client's Marketplace and Guard UIs are fully functional and secure. The Guard UI allows comprehensive, dynamic BUNKERGUARD management with a live 3D preview. The Marketplace UI supports all MVE transaction types with detailed filtering. Both are driven by live data from the Rust backend and feature deeply integrated NAR narratives.
Acceptance Criteria: All UI features for the economy and personalization loops are implemented, tested, and provide a polished user experience.
6. Validated & Secure Core Loops
Description: The core economic loops (buy/sell/trade) and BUNKERGUARD personalization loops (equip/progress/customize) are fully testable, functional, and secure. Comprehensive integration and security tests have validated data consistency, transaction integrity, and contextual narrative quality across all systems.
Acceptance Criteria: All P4 E2E and security tests have passed, and are signed off by QA and Security.
In summary, the MVE now has a functional, secure economy, deep player avatar personalization reflecting all 12 classes and affiliations with dynamic GDD-driven mechanics, and rich AI storytelling integrated with these systems, all operating on the hardened Rust backend and enforced by the on-chain L3 smart contracts. The platform is now ready for the final step of MVE feature development: fully integrating the Mission system to close the play-to-earn loops in Phase 5.
