Initial Task for Phase 4.0:
(4.0) Create Phase 4 Progress Log & Review Phase 3 Deliverables / Phase 4 DoR Verification
(Security, Mechanics & Economy Focus for MVE)
Technical Reference
o docs/progress_logs/progress_phase_3.md
o Phase 3 Deliverable documentation
o Game Design Documents (GDDs) for Dynamic Stat/Class/Affiliation System and Marketplace Functionality.
o docs/PROJECT_GOVERNANCE_AND_WORKFLOWS.md (SDL Charter)

Library/Tool Versions:
| Library/Tool | Version | Notes |
|--------------|---------|-------|
| Qt SDK | 6.9.2 (MSVC 2022 64-bit) | Path: D:\DOCUMENTS\Qt\6.9.2\msvc2022_64 |
| cxx-qt Crate | 0.7.2 | The crate aims to support all Qt 6 versions; pinned for stability. |
| rustc | 1.80.0 (Stable) | Pinned via rust-toolchain.toml. |
Context/Problem Statement
Phase 3 delivered a feature-complete platform with all the major social and community hubs. Now, we are about to undertake the most complex on-chain development of the MVE: the dynamic Bunkerguard state system. This system is the core of the in-verse progression and economy. A formal kickoff is absolutely critical to ensure the Phase 3 platform is stable and, most importantly, that the GDDs containing the precise mathematical formulas for this dynamic system are finalized, unambiguous, and signed off before any smart contract code is written.
Measurable Objectives
o A docs/progress_logs/progress_phase_4.md file is created.
o A Phase 4 kickoff meeting is successfully conducted and its minutes are documented.
o All P3 deliverables are formally reviewed and signed off.
o The GDDs for all P4-scope mechanics, especially the dynamic stat calculation formulas, are formally signed off by all relevant leads, including Security and Game Design.
o A formal "Phase 4 Initiated" outcome is declared and logged.
Implementation Guidance
Action:
o Create docs/progress_logs/progress_phase_4.md with the same detailed structure, emphasizing security of economic logic, correctness of dynamic stat/class calculations, and data integrity.
o Conduct a Phase 4 kickoff meeting. Formally review all Phase 3 deliverables (fully functional Control Center Client with all platform hubs: Nexus, Plaza, Social, Constructs).
o Verify Phase 4 "Definition of Ready" (DoR) criteria are met. This must include:
Stable Rust Service APIs v0.1 (proven with P3 live data).
Finalized and signed-off GDDs for:
Full Marketplace functionality (buy, sell, list, MVE-scoped auctions, fees, royalties).
All 10 ItemType interactions in the Guard UI.
The precise mathematical formulas and logic for dynamic stat calculation, class assignment (dominant stat thresholds, tie-breaking rules), and affiliation assignment (item trait points + reputation point thresholds).
Stripe integration flow for Credit purchases.
All new NAR integration points for these economic and personalization systems.
o Review PROJECT_GOVERNANCE_AND_WORKFLOWS.MD for SDL activities specific to Phase 4 (e.g., mandatory security reviews for L3 smart contract economic logic, marketplace transaction flows, dynamic stat calculation to prevent exploits, payment processing security).
Update docs/progress_logs/progress_phase_4.md: Log the creation of this file, the kickoff, and formal confirmation of Phase 4 readiness. Explicitly confirm the GDDs for the dynamic Guard/Marketplace systems are signed off and align with the L3 Smart Contracts and Indexer capabilities.
Design Rationale
This kickoff is the most critical GDD-to-smart-contract handover in the project. The dynamic state system's formulas will be encoded into immutable on-chain logic. Any flaw in the GDD's mathematical or logical specification could lead to permanent, exploitable bugs in the economy. This formal review and sign-off process, especially with mandatory Game Design and Security lead participation, is the primary risk mitigation for this entire phase.
Operational Considerations
The finalized GDDs for the dynamic state system become the unbreakable specification for the core on-chain logic. All subsequent development, QA, and balancing will be measured against these documents.
Verification & Validation Criteria
o Kickoff Meeting Minutes are recorded and approved.
o The Phase 3 Deliverable Checklist is formally signed off.
o The Phase 4 DoR Checklist, with a specific focus on the GDDs containing the mathematical formulas, is verified and signed off.
Testing Methodologies
N/A (Process verification).
Version Control Strategy
o Branching: The progress_phase_4.md file is created on a feature/phase-4-setup branch.
o Commits: The Git Commit message for this task will be exactly as specified.
Security Audit & Compliance Checkpoints
The Security Lead's formal sign-off on the GDDs is mandatory, confirming they have reviewed the defined mechanics for potential economic exploits (e.g., infinite stat loops, flawed rounding, etc.).
The Security Lead must approve the SDL plan for Phase 4, which will include a dedicated external audit for the finalized dynamic state smart contracts.
ReviewedBy: Project Manager, Lead Architect, All Tech Leads, Security Lead, QA Lead, Game Design Lead (mandatory for mechanics/economy GDD verification).
ReviewOutcome: Phase 4 Initiated (Full Economic & Dynamic Personalization Loop Implementation Plan Confirmed for MVE).
ValidationMethod: Kickoff Meeting Minutes recorded. P3 Deliverables Verified. P4 DoR Checklist Confirmed.
