Context/Problem Statement
The Marketplace smart contract logic from Phase 2 is functional but basic. To support a complete MVE economy, it must be fully implemented and hardened to handle all core commercial operations, including listing, delisting, buying, selling, auction settlement, and primary sales from BUNKER CORP. This logic must be atomic, secure, and resilient to economic exploits and race conditions. This task involves implementing the full, GDD-defined transaction logic for all marketplace operations directly within the L3 smart contracts.
Measurable Objectives
The Marketplace L3 smart contract is fully implemented and hardened to handle all MVE-scoped operations.
The execute_trade function correctly handles multi-party atomic transfers of NFTs and Credits, including the 15% fee.
The settle_auction function is implemented with robust, off-chain signature validation.
Logic for BUNKER CORP and Class Pack sales is functional.
The implementation is validated by integration tests and passes a mandatory security code review.
Implementation Guidance
Action: Fully implement and harden the complete marketplace transaction logic within the L3 Smart Contracts. This logic must handle all MVE-scoped operations (buy, sell, list, delist, auction settlement, Corp/Class Pack sales) for items with their full, GDD-defined NftDetailsProto attributes.
Implementation Details (in Marketplace.rs L3 Smart Contract):
a. list_item_for_sale(nft_id: U256, price_in_credits: U256) Intent:
1. Validation: Verify msg.sender owns the nft_id. Verify the NFT is not soulbound and not already listed.
2. Canonical State Update: Update the NftMutableStateProto for the nft_id, setting its market_status to a new struct containing the price and seller.
3. Event Generation: Emit an NftMarketStatusUpdated event.
b. delist_item(nft_id: U256) Intent:
1. Validation: Verify msg.sender owns the nft_id and it is currently listed by them.
2. Canonical State Update: Update the NftMutableStateProto for the nft_id, clearing the market_status.
3. Event Generation: Emit an NftMarketStatusUpdated event.
c. execute_trade(nft_id: U256) Intent:
* State Loading & Validation:
* Read the NftMutableStateProto for the nft_id to get the seller_id and price_in_credits.
* Verify the buyer (msg.sender) has a sufficient credits_balance.
* Atomic Transfer:
* Debit price_in_credits from the buyer.
* Credit the seller with price * (1 - 0.15).
* Credit the BUNKER_CORP treasury address with the price * 0.15 fee.
* Transfer the NFT ownership from the seller to the buyer.
* This entire sequence must occur within a single function to be atomic.
* Event Generation: Emit TradeExecuted, NftTransferred, and CreditsUpdated events.
d. Auction Logic (MVE Scope - Off-Chain Bids, On-Chain Secure Settlement):
i. The off-chain Rust Marketplace Service will manage the bidding process. When an auction ends, it will submit a single transaction to the smart contract.
ii. settle_auction(auctioned_nft_id: U256, winning_bidder_id: Address, winning_bid_amount: U256, marketplace_signature: Vec<u8>) Intent:
1. Signature Validation: The smart contract must verify the marketplace_signature. It will reconstruct a digest of the auction results and use ECDSA.recover to verify the signature was created by the trusted Marketplace Service's public key (stored in the contract). This ensures only the trusted service can settle auctions.
2. Execute Trade: If the signature is valid, the contract then executes the same internal _execute_trade logic as above to transfer the funds and the NFT.
3. Event Generation: Generate an AuctionSettled event in addition to the trade events.
e. BUNKER CORP Sales & Class Packs:
* These are handled by having the off-chain Marketplace Service submit execute_trade transactions where the seller is the BUNKER_CORP address. For Class Packs (a bundle of NFTs), the service can submit a batch of transactions.
Security Hardening:
o Rigorous validation of all inputs.
o Use ReentrancyGuard on all state-changing public functions.
o Use the L3's optimistic concurrency controls (e.g., nonce) to prevent race conditions (e.g., buying an item the instant it's delisted).
o Ensure auction settlement signature validation is robust and prevents replay attacks.
Update docs/progress_logs/progress_phase_4.md:
o Log the implementation of the execute_trade and settle_auction on-chain logic.
o Document the security measures for the marketplace, especially the off-chain signature scheme for auctions.
Design Rationale
Placing the final settlement and transfer logic on-chain provides the highest level of security and trust for all marketplace transactions. The off-chain signature pattern for auction settlement is a highly efficient and secure hybrid approach. It avoids the immense gas costs and network spam of on-chain bidding wars, while still ensuring that the final, most valuable state change-the transfer of ownership-is cryptographically secured and verified on the immutable L3 ledger.
Operational Considerations
Local-First: The full marketplace logic will be tested against the local Arbitrum Orbit simulation. The Marketplace Service running in Docker Compose will be configured with a private key for signing auction settlements.
Cloud-Ready: The Marketplace Service's private key is a critical secret that will be stored in AWS Secrets Manager in production. The public key will be stored immutably in the Marketplace smart contract.
Verification & Validation Criteria
Integration tests demonstrate successful, consistent, and secure execute_trade and settle_auction flows.
Tests for signature validation, re-entrancy, and insufficient funds correctly revert as expected.
The 15% fee is correctly distributed in all P2P trades.
Testing Methodologies
Unit Tests (Smart Contracts): Exhaustive tests for every function in the Marketplace contract. Test all validation logic, fee calculations, and the settle_auction signature verification with both valid and invalid signatures.
Integration Tests: Create multi-user test scripts that simulate a full auction: Player A lists, Player B's bids are managed by a mock off-chain service, the mock service signs the result, and a test harness calls settle_auction to finalize the trade on the local L3 node.
Version Control Strategy
Branching: The enhanced marketplace contracts will be developed on a feature/l3-marketplace-module branch.
Commits: The Git Commit message for this task will be exactly as specified.
Security Audit & Compliance Checkpoints
A mandatory, in-depth security audit of the entire Marketplace.rs contract is required before this phase can be completed.
The audit must focus on the execute_trade logic (to prevent asset duplication/loss) and the settle_auction signature scheme (to prevent forgeries or replay attacks).
ReviewedBy: L3 Smart Contracts Lead, Distributed Systems Expert, Security Lead, Game Economy Designer.
ReviewOutcome: Approved.
ValidationMethod: Integration tests demonstrate successful, consistent, and secure multi-shard executeTrade and settleAuction flows, including testing failure and compensation paths.
