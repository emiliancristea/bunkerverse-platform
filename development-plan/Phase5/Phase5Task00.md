Initial Task for Phase 5:
(5.0) Create Phase 5 Progress Log & Review Phase 4 Deliverables / Phase 5 DoR Verification
(Security, Game Design & Mission Logic Focus for MVE)
Technical Reference
docs/progress_logs/progress_phase_4.md
Phase 4 Deliverable documentation
Game Design Documents (GDDs) for all MVE Missions
docs/PROJECT_GOVERNANCE_AND_WORKFLOWS.md (SDL Charter)
Context/Problem Statement
Phase 4 delivered a fully dynamic in-verse economy and progression system. This is the final major feature implementation phase of the MVE. It focuses on building the Mission Service that will bridge gameplay actions with on-chain rewards, thus closing the play-to-earn loop. A formal kickoff is critical to ensure the Phase 4 platform is stable and that the GDDs defining all missions, objectives, prerequisites, and rewards are finalized and unambiguous before implementation.
Measurable Objectives
o A docs/progress_logs/progress_phase_5.md file is created.
o A Phase 5 kickoff meeting is successfully conducted and its minutes are documented.
o All P4 deliverables are formally reviewed and signed off.
o The GDDs for all MVE missions are formally signed off by all relevant leads.
o A formal "Phase 5 Initiated" outcome is declared and logged.
Implementation Guidance
Action:
o Create docs/progress_logs/progress_phase_5.md with the same detailed structure, emphasizing the security of the reward-granting process and the integrity of the full play-to-earn data loop.
o Conduct a Phase 5 kickoff meeting. Formally review all Phase 4 deliverables (functional L3 Smart Contracts for full marketplace & dynamic BunkerGuard logic; Rust Indexer reflecting this rich live state; functional C++ CC Marketplace/Guard UIs with rich NAR; Stripe monetization loop implemented).
o Verify Phase 5 "Definition of Ready" (DoR) criteria are met. This must include:
Stable Service APIs v0.1 (proven with P4 dynamic data).
Post-MVE placeholder hooks in the Game Server stubs are ready for full integration with a functional Mission Service.
Finalized and signed-off Game Design Documents (GDDs) for all MVE missions. These documents must contain:
A comprehensive list of all missions, their descriptions, and dependencies.
Detailed, machine-readable objectives for each mission (e.g., event_type: 'ARCHIVE_POST_CREATED', condition: 'category=guides', target_count: 1).
Precise prerequisites for starting missions (e.g., required_class: 'Cybermancer', required_affiliation: 'Loyal').
A definitive list of all rewards for each mission, including exact XP amounts and the specific GDD item_gdd_id for every NFT reward, which maps to a full NftDetailsProto in the on-chain GDD registry.
o Review PROJECT_GOVERNANCE_AND_WORKFLOWS.MD for SDL activities in P5 (e.g., security reviews for Mission Service logic, prevention of reward duplication/spoofing exploits).
Update docs/progress_logs/progress_phase_5.md: Log the creation of this file, the kickoff, and formal confirmation of Phase 5 readiness. Explicitly confirm that the MVE mission designs are finalized, signed off, and map to the L3 Smart Contract reward capabilities.
Design Rationale
The Mission System is the primary driver of guided content and the main vector for play-to-earn rewards. A rigorous GDD and DoR process is essential because this service will be granted the authority to trigger the minting and transfer of valuable on-chain assets. Any ambiguity in the rules could lead to severe economic exploits. This kickoff ensures perfect alignment between design, security, and engineering before this critical system is built.
Operational Considerations
The GDDs signed off on in this task become the canonical specification for all MVE missions. All subsequent development, QA, and content design will be measured against these documents. The Mission Service will become a critical, stateful component of the backend that requires its own backup and monitoring strategy.
Verification & Validation Criteria
Kickoff Meeting Minutes are recorded and approved.
The Phase 4 Deliverable Checklist is formally signed off.
The Phase 5 DoR Checklist, with a specific focus on the mission GDDs, is verified and signed off.
Testing Methodologies
N/A (Process verification).
Version Control Strategy
o Branching: The progress_phase_5.md file is created on a feature/phase-5-setup branch.
o Commits: The Git Commit message for this task will be exactly as specified.
Security Audit & Compliance Checkpoints
o The Security Lead's formal sign-off on the GDDs is mandatory, confirming they have reviewed the mission and reward designs for potential economic exploits.
o The Security Lead must approve the SDL plan for Phase 5, which will include dedicated testing for reward duplication and spoofing attacks.
ReviewedBy: Project Manager, Lead Architect, All Tech Leads, Security Lead, QA Lead, Game Design Lead (mandatory for mission GDD verification).
ReviewOutcome: Phase 5 Initiated (Full Mission System & Game Loop Integration Plan Confirmed for MVE).
ValidationMethod: Kickoff Meeting Minutes recorded. P4 Deliverables Verified. P5 DoR Checklist Confirmed.
