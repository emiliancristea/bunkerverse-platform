Task 5.5 (Revised): End-to-End MVE Platform Integration & Security Testing
(All Platform Loops, All Rust Systems Under Sustained Load, All Client Features, Vulnerability Probing - Principles O, R)
Technical Reference
All Phase 3, 4, and 5 Test Plans
docker-compose.yml for the full P5 MVE Platform stack
bunkerverse-admin-cli tool and automated test scripts
Context/Problem Statement
With the completion of the Mission Service and the final UI polish, all features of the MVE platform are now complete. This is the final and most comprehensive validation gate before we declare the platform feature-complete. This task involves conducting an exhaustive end-to-end integration and security testing campaign on the entire, interconnected MVE platform on the staging-equivalent local environment, now that all its features are implemented.
Measurable Objectives
All E2E tests from previous phases are successfully re-executed to validate against regressions.
New, complex, combined-loop scenarios are created and successfully executed, validating the interplay between all platform features.
A final pass of security E2E tests is conducted, focusing on the newly implemented Mission Service and reward loops.
The MVE platform is formally declared feature-complete, stable, and secure by QA and Security leads.
Implementation Guidance
Action: Conduct the final, exhaustive E2E integration and security testing of all interconnected MVE systems in the local Docker Compose simulation, now that all platform features are complete.
Test Procedures:
a. Execute all E2E tests from previous phases (P2.9, P3.10, P4.10) to ensure no regressions have been introduced.
b. New Combined Loop Scenarios (All 12 Classes):
i. Create and execute new, complex test scripts/plans that cover the full platform loop. For example:
1. User logs in.
2. User adds a friend in the SOCIAL interface.
3. User accepts a mission in the CAMP to "Post a guide in the Archives."
4. User navigates to the ARCHIVES and creates a high-quality post.
5. An admin rewards the post with NTC via the CLI.
6. The user navigates back to the CAMP and verifies the mission is complete.
7. The user claims the mission reward (e.g., a rare NFT).
8. The user navigates to the GUARD UI, verifies the NFT is in their inventory, and equips it, triggering a full dynamic state change.
9. The user lists another item for sale on the MARKETPLACE.
* This full loop will be tested for a representative sample of the 12 BunkerClasses.
c. Security E2E Testing (Final Pass for MVE Platform):
* Attempt to exploit the mission system:
* Try to claim a reward for an uncompleted mission.
* Try to claim a reward multiple times.
* Verify the Mission Service and L3 Smart Contracts reject these attempts.
* Test all authenticated gRPC endpoints with invalid/missing/expired JWTs or service tokens.
* Review logs from all systems during the final high-load E2E tests for security anomalies, excessive error rates, or sensitive data leakage.
* Perform final, focused fuzz testing on the MissionService.ClaimMissionReward gRPC endpoint.
Update docs/progress_logs/progress_phase_5.md:
o Document the comprehensive E2E test scenarios.
o Log the outcomes, performance metrics, security test findings, and any remediations.
o Provide a final assessment of the MVE's stability, feature completeness, and security posture.
Design Rationale
This final, all-encompassing integration test is the ultimate validation of the "Platform-First" doctrine. By proving that the entire, complex social and economic platform is stable, secure, and data-consistent before the integration of any games, we de-risk the entire project significantly. It ensures we have a rock-solid foundation to build the games upon post-MVE.
Operational Considerations
The test scenarios and scripts created in this task will form the definitive "full regression suite" for the MVE platform. This suite will be run against all future release candidates to ensure core platform functionality is never broken.
Verification & Validation Criteria
All defined P5 E2E tests pass.
The MVE is declared feature-complete and stable under simulated load, with all platform systems securely integrated and data flowing correctly.
The QA and Security Leads provide formal sign-off for the P5 Scope.
Testing Methodologies
A combination of automated test scripts (using the Admin CLI and gRPC test harnesses) and heavily scripted manual QA for validating the full, cross-feature user journeys.
Version Control Strategy
Branching: The final integration tests and any required fixes are developed on a feature/p5-final-integration-tests branch.
Commits: The Git Commit message for this task will be exactly as specified.
Security Audit & Compliance Checkpoints
This task serves as the final security gate for the MVE platform feature set. The Security Lead must review and sign off on the results of all security E2E tests, especially those targeting the Mission and reward systems.
ReviewedBy: QA Lead, All Tech Leads, Lead Architect, Product Owner, SRE Lead, Security Lead.
ReviewOutcome: MVE Core Platform Loops, Integration & Security Approved for P5 Scope.
ValidationMethod: All P5 E2E tests pass. The MVE is declared feature-complete and stable under load, with all systems securely integrated.

Phase 5 Deliverable
(Security-Hardened Process-Hardened Foundation with a Feature-Complete MVE Platform & All Core Loops - Incorporating V2.4 BUNKERVERSE Overview)
Technical Reference
All Phase 5 Test Plans and E2E Test Results (from Task 5.5)
docs/progress_logs/progress_phase_5.md (as the master audit trail for this deliverable)
Context/Problem Statement
Phase 5 was the final major feature-development phase of the MVE, focusing on implementing the Mission Service and closing all the core platform loops. This deliverable serves as the formal summary and acceptance checklist for this entire phase, confirming that the project has successfully built and integrated a complete, end-to-end play-to-earn (via platform engagement) ecosystem.
Measurable Objectives
All 4 Acceptance Criteria for the Phase 5 deliverables listed below are met and have been formally signed off on by the designated leads.
The progress_logs/progress_phase_5.md log is complete, audited, and provides a full audit trail for the entire phase.
A formal Phase 5 Closure Review Meeting has been successfully conducted, resulting in a "Go" decision to proceed to the final production-hardening phase.
Implementation Guidance
Upon completion of Phase 5, the BUNKERVERSE MVE is a feature-complete and interconnected ecosystem for its defined launch scope. All core platform loops are fully integrated and security-hardened.
1. Fully Functional & Integrated Rust Mission System:
Description: The Rust Mission Service is fully implemented and securely tracks all MVE missions in its persistent MySQL database. It correctly checks dynamic prerequisites against the live Indexer and orchestrates the granting of all GDD-defined L3 Smart Contract rewards (XP, NTC, NFTs).
Acceptance Criteria: The service is stable, secure against common exploits (e.g., double-claiming), and correctly manages the entire mission lifecycle for platform-based activities.
2. Performance-Tuned & Hardened Rust Backend:
Description: The Arbitrum Orbit L3 and Rust Indexer are proven to robustly handle the high-volume, concurrent load from the full suite of platform economic and social transactions, meeting all performance and stability targets.
Acceptance Criteria: The backend is signed off by the SRE and QA Leads as ready for production-level loads for the MVE platform scope.
3. Feature-Complete Client with Deeply Integrated NAR:
Description: The C++ Control Center Client has fully functional UIs for all MVE features (NEXUS, PLAZA, CONSTRUCTS, GUARD, SOCIAL). These UIs dynamically reflect all aspects of player progression and rewards, driven by live data from the secure Rust backend. The local Rust NAR is deeply integrated, providing compelling, contextually rich narratives for all major progression milestones.
Acceptance Criteria: The client provides a complete, polished, and engaging user experience for the entire MVE platform feature set.
4. Validated End-to-End MVE Loops & Security:
Description: All end-to-end MVE loops (economic, personalization, social, and the new mission-based progression/reward loop) are demonstrable, stable, secure, and validated through comprehensive integration testing.
Acceptance Criteria: All P5 integration, load, and security E2E tests are passed and signed off by the QA and Security leads. The MVE is formally declared feature-complete.
In summary, Phase 5 transforms the MVE into a complete, living system with an active, rule-enforcing heart (the L3 Smart Contracts) and a fully realized set of user-facing platform features. The platform now has its core canonical logic for all major loops functionally implemented with security hardening. This detailed state is accurately reflected live in the Rust Indexer. The system is robustly prepared for the final productionization, polish, and intensive pre-launch validation in subsequent phases.
