Task 5.4 (Revised): Client UI Finalization & Narrative Polish
(Full Platform Progression, Rewards, and Dynamic Narratives - Principles H, J, K, P, O, R)
Technical Reference
All Phase 3, 4, and 5 GDDs and UI Definition Documents
CXX-Qt and QML Documentation
Finalized API contracts for all backend services
Context/Problem Statement
Throughout the previous phases, we have built out all the major hubs of the Control Center (Nexus, Plaza, Social, Guard, Constructs). While each has been implemented, this task represents a dedicated phase of refinement and deep integration. The goal is to polish all relevant UI sections to fully and dynamically reflect all the new progression and reward flows, and to refine the NAR to generate compelling narratives for this complete platform experience. This ensures the client is not just a collection of features, but a single, cohesive, polished product.
Measurable Objectives
All client UI sections are finalized and polished to reflect live data from all platform features (missions, rewards, dynamic state).
The Rust NAR is refined with advanced prompt engineering to generate high-quality, compelling narratives for all core platform loops.
The client provides a complete, seamless, and engaging user experience for all MVE platform features.
Implementation Guidance
Action: Finalize and polish all relevant C++ Control Center Client UI sections to fully reflect live game progression and all reward types, and to display the rich, dynamic Rust NAR narratives, all driven by the functional and secure Rust backend.
UI Feedback Loop Finalization (QML & Rust):
o MissionBoard UI (MissionsScreen.qml): Ensure the "Claim Reward" flow is perfect. Upon a successful claim (confirmed by the L3->Indexer->Client update loop), the UI must provide immediate, rich feedback: a "Rewards Claimed!" notification with icons for each item received.
o State Synchronization: Verify that the claimed NFT instantly appears in the Guard UI inventory, and that XP/NTC balances update on the HOMESCREEN and in the Guard UI, all driven by the client's Rust logic reacting to live data updates from the Indexer via WebSockets.
Constructs UI (Post-Gameplay Summary):
This UI is a placeholder for the post-MVE games, but the post-activity summary screen logic can be built now for Arcade sessions.
After a user finishes an Arcade game and a result is submitted, the client will fetch a "post-session summary." The UI will display a comprehensive breakdown of the session (score, challenges completed, rewards earned) and feature a prominent, rich NAR narrative.
Logs & History (GUARD and other sections):
Ensure the Guard and History logs are now fully populated with mission completions, achievements earned (from in-verse activities), and items minted from mission rewards, all accompanied by their specific, contextual Rust NAR narratives.
Advanced Prompt Engineering (in Client's Rust App Logic):
o This is the final narrative polish pass for the platform.
o Develop and extensively refine a large set of highly specific prompt templates for all platform events: mission acceptances, progress updates, completions, all reward types, marketplace transactions, and social actions.
o Qualitative Evaluation & Iteration (Critical):
Conduct dedicated, structured playtesting sessions with the internal team, focusing on the full platform loop.
The goal is to trigger a wide array of platform events (completing missions, buying rare items, etc.) with different dynamic Bunkerguard states.
Collect all generated NAR narratives and evaluate them against a strict rubric for contextual accuracy, tone, and variety.
Iterate rapidly on the Rust prompt templates until the narrative quality is consistently high and specific across the entire platform experience.
Design Rationale
A polished, cohesive, and narratively rich user experience is what elevates a functional platform into an immersive world. This dedicated finalization phase ensures that all the individual features built in previous tasks are woven together into a seamless whole. The final narrative polish pass is critical for ensuring the AI storyteller feels consistently intelligent and engaging across all aspects of the platform.
Operational Considerations
The final set of polished UI components and advanced NAR prompts will serve as the "gold standard" for all future development, including the post-MVE integration of the game clients.
Verification & Validation Criteria
E2E tests show that the full play-to-earn loops for all MVE platform features are correctly and seamlessly reflected in the client UI with dynamic updates.
Extensive internal qualitative playtesting confirms the NAR generates varied, deeply contextual, and engaging narratives for a wide spectrum of platform events.
The final UI is reviewed and approved by the UI/UX Lead as meeting the project's quality bar.
Testing Methodologies
Qualitative Evaluation: The primary methodology for the NAR component is human review against a formal rubric.
E2E Testing: Scripted manual E2E tests will be performed to validate the full reward-to-UI update loop.
Version Control Strategy
Branching: This work represents the final polish for multiple features and will be developed on a feature/p5-ui-polish-nar branch.
Commits: The Git Commit message for this task will be exactly as specified.
Security Audit & Compliance Checkpoints
A final security review of the UI will be conducted to ensure that in the process of displaying rich data, no sensitive information is inadvertently leaked.
ReviewedBy: Client Lead, Frontend Lead, Rust Mission/L3/Indexer Leads, QA Lead, UI/UX Lead, Security Lead, AI Lead, Narrative Designer.
ReviewOutcome: Approved.
ValidationMethod: E2E tests show the full play-to-earn loops for all MVE platform features are correctly reflected in the UI with dynamic updates and rich, contextually accurate NAR narratives.
