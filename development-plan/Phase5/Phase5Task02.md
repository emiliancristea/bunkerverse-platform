Task 5.2 (Revised): L3 & Backend - Final Performance Tuning & Stress Testing
(Sustained Platform Load - Principles J, K, N, O, R)
Technical Reference
Load testing tools (e.g., k6 with gRPC support, custom Rust clients)
Production monitoring stack (Prometheus, Grafana, Alertmanager)
Finalized L3 Smart Contract ABIs and Service API Contracts
Context/Problem Statement
With the implementation of the Mission Service (Task 5.1), all major backend services and on-chain logic for the MVE platform are now functionally complete. The system will now be subjected to its most complex and varied load profile, with concurrent interactions across the marketplace, forums, social systems, and mission-claiming loops. Before we can consider the MVE feature-complete, we must conduct a final round of performance tuning and stress testing to ensure the entire backend data plane (L3 and Indexer) can handle this sustained, high-volume, concurrent transaction load.
Measurable Objectives
The entire backend stack is proven to be stable and performant under a sustained, mixed load of all platform features.
Key performance metrics (L3 TPS, transaction finality, Indexer lag) are measured and meet or exceed defined MVE targets.
The system correctly recovers from simulated failures of its core components (resilience testing).
Implementation Guidance
Action: Conduct a final round of performance tuning, stress testing, and hardening for the entire Rust backend data plane (L3 and Indexer). The goal is to ensure the system can handle the sustained, high-volume, concurrent transaction load generated by the full economic, social, and progression activity from the completed platform.
Implementation & Testing Details:
o End-to-End Flow Optimization: Profile the entire transaction lifecycle under a realistic, mixed load: Client Action -> Service Logic -> L3 Transaction -> L3 Event -> Indexer Ingestion -> Indexer Query. Identify and address any remaining bottlenecks in this full loop.
o Database Tuning:
L3 Node (Arbitrum Orbit): Final tuning of the sequencer's memory, batching policies, and other performance parameters.
Indexer (Elasticsearch/Typesense): Final tuning of index mappings, shard counts, and refresh intervals to balance query performance with ingestion speed for the rich platform state data.
o Combined Stress Tests (Staging Environment with Production-like Config):
Use sophisticated test harnesses to simulate thousands of concurrent users.
The load profile must be a realistic MVE mix:
Economic Load: Continuous marketplace activity (listings, bids, and executeTrade transactions).
Progression Load: High frequency of Guard UI updates (equipItem transactions causing dynamic stat recalculations).
Social & Mission Load: Frequent addSocialConnection transactions and claimMissionReward transactions.
Run these tests for extended durations (e.g., 8-24 hours).
o Metrics to Validate:
Sustained aggregate L3 TPS (Transactions Per Second).
P95 and P99 end-to-end transaction finality latency (from transaction submission to being queryable in Indexer).
Indexer ingestion lag.
CPU, memory, and disk I/O utilization on the L3 sequencer and Indexer nodes in the local Docker Compose simulation.
o Resilience Testing: During the stress test, deliberately kill an L3 sequencer node (if running a multi-node PoA test setup), an Indexer node, or a critical database container (e.g., Redis). Verify that the system remains operational and that the failed node can recover and resynchronize correctly without data loss.
Update docs/progress_logs/progress_phase_5.md:
Log final tuning parameters for the L3 sequencer and the Indexer.
Document the setup and detailed results of the sustained mixed-load stress tests (graphs of TPS, latencies, resource usage).
Report on the successful outcome of the resilience tests.
Design Rationale
This final, dedicated performance and stability test is a critical step before the MVE can be considered "complete." It validates the entire system architecture against a load profile that simulates a successful launch, uncovering any late-stage bottlenecks, race conditions, or cascading failures that are impossible to find with single-feature testing.
Operational Considerations
Local-First: This intensive stress test will push the limits of the Windows 11 machine and the Docker Compose simulation. It will provide a crucial performance baseline for the local environment.
Cloud-Ready: The results of this stress test (TPS, resource utilization) are the most critical data points we will have for sizing the production infrastructure (e.g., determining the required CPU/RAM for EKS nodes and RDS instances) for the future cloud migration.
Verification & Validation Criteria
The backend stack maintains stability and meets or exceeds all defined MVE performance targets (TPS, latency) under the sustained, mixed-load stress test.
The system correctly recovers from simulated failures under load.
The SRE/DevOps and Lead Architect formally sign off on the platform's performance and stability.
Testing Methodologies
Automated load testing using sophisticated test harnesses (e.g., k6 with gRPC support) to generate a realistic, concurrent mix of API calls and L3 transactions. Manual and scripted fault injection to test resilience.
Version Control Strategy
Branching: The test harnesses and any necessary performance tuning code will be developed on a feature/p5-stress-testing branch.
Commits: The Git Commit message for this task will be exactly as specified.
Security Audit & Compliance Checkpoints
The Security Lead will monitor the system during the stress test for any security-related anomalies (e.g., excessive error rates, potential DoS vectors). The results will inform the final hardening of production rate limits and firewall rules.
ReviewedBy: SRE Lead, QA Lead, Security Lead, Lead Architect, All Backend Leads.
ReviewOutcome: Approved for MVE Launch Load & Security.
ValidationMethod: The L3 and Indexer demonstrate stability and meet all defined MVE performance targets under sustained, realistic, mixed-load stress tests.
