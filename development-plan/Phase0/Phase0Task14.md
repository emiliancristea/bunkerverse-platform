docs/PROJECT_GOVERNANCE_AND_WORKFLOWS.md
Context/Problem Statement
This is the final gate of Phase 0. All planning, setup, prototyping, and foundational work is complete. Before committing the project to the intensive and costly implementation work of Phase 1, we must conduct a comprehensive, formal review of everything accomplished in Phase 0. This ensures that all stakeholders are in complete agreement that the project is in a secure, robust, and well-documented state to proceed. This task formalizes the entry criteria for Phase 1 and serves as the ultimate quality and security checkpoint for the entire foundational phase.
Measurable Objectives
A finalized and approved DEFINITION_OF_READY_PHASE_1.md document is created.
A formal Phase 0 Closure Review Meeting is successfully conducted and its minutes are documented.
A formal "Go/No-Go" decision for initiating Phase 1 is made and recorded.
Mandatory, explicit sign-offs for the project's security posture, the validated technology stack (including Arbitrum Orbit), and the dual-mode architecture are obtained and documented.
Implementation Guidance
Action: Formally define the "Definition of Ready" (DoR) criteria that must be met before any Phase 1 task can commence. Conduct a comprehensive Phase 0 closure review meeting with all key stakeholders to verify all Phase 0 deliverables are complete, all First Principles have been adhered to, the chosen MVE technology stack is validated and approved, the dual-mode architecture is sound, and the project is in a secure and robust state to proceed to Phase 1. This includes a mandatory security sign-off.
Definition of Ready for Phase 1 Tasks (docs/governance/DEFINITION_OF_READY_PHASE_1.md):
This document will list the prerequisites for starting any Phase 1 development task. Criteria include:
Relevant Phase 0 Deliverables Complete & Approved: The specific P0 deliverable (e.g., "Finalized API Contracts v0.1," "Validated Arbitrum Orbit PoC Report") related to the Phase 1 task must be formally signed off.
Technology Stack Confirmed: The Phase 1 task relies on technologies (e.g., Arbitrum Orbit for L3 Smart Contracts, Axum for Marketplace Service, CXX-Qt for client) whose selection was finalized and PoC-validated in Phase 0.
Schemas & API Contracts Stable (v0.1): The P0.3 finalized schemas and API contracts (v0.1) that the Phase 1 task will implement against are approved and versioned.
Security Review of P0 Designs Completed: Security reviews and threat models for the relevant P0 component designs and API contracts have been completed and signed off.
Development Environment Ready: Developers assigned to the Phase 1 task have a fully functional development environment, including the local Docker Compose simulation, as per docs/DEVELOPMENT_ENVIRONMENT.md.
Smart Stubs Available: Necessary smart stubs for dependencies of the Phase 1 task are functional and available in the local Docker Compose simulation.
Dual-Mode Design Understood: The implementing developer understands how the enable_crypto / show_crypto flags and the broader dual-mode strategy apply to the Phase 1 task.
Phase 1 Task Clearly Defined: The Phase 1 task itself (from the Phase 1 plan) has clear objectives, acceptance criteria, and estimated effort.
Phase 0 Closure Review Meeting:
Attendees: Project Manager, Lead Architect, All Tech Leads (Client Rust/QML, C++ Game Dev Stubs, etc.), QA Lead, SRE/DevOps Lead, Security Lead (mandatory), Product Owner.
Agenda:
Systematic review of each Phase 0 deliverable against its acceptance criteria.
Verification of docs/progress_logs/progress_phase_0.md completeness and accuracy.
Confirmation of PoC validation and formal sign-off for all chosen MVE technologies: Arbitrum Orbit (L3 Framework), Axum (Marketplace Service), Elasticsearch/Typesense (Indexer), Gemma3/llama.cpp (NAR), CXX-Qt with QML (Client UI), IPFS (NFT Metadata).
Review of the overall security posture at the end of Phase 0: outcomes of security assessments, API security reviews, CI security scan setup, FFI hardening. Security Lead provides a formal statement on security readiness for Phase 1.
Review and approval of the "Definition of Ready for Phase 1 Tasks."
Discussion of any outstanding risks or open questions before proceeding.
Formal Go/No-Go decision for concluding Phase 0 and initiating Phase 1.
Update docs/progress_logs/progress_phase_0.md:
Log the creation and content of docs/governance/DEFINITION_OF_READY_PHASE_1.md.
Record detailed minutes of the Phase 0 Closure Review Meeting.
Explicitly document the security sign-off for Phase 0 from the Security Lead, noting that all Principle R objectives for P0 have been met to the agreed standard.
Explicitly document the formal approval of the chosen MVE technology stack based on PoC validations, with an Arbitrum Orbit L3 named as the foundational netchain framework.
Explicitly document the approval of the dual-mode architectural approach.
Design Rationale
This final, formal review ensures absolute alignment and prevents the project from moving forward with unresolved issues, technical debt, or stakeholder misunderstandings. The mandatory security sign-off elevates security from an engineering concern to a core project requirement, ensuring that we only proceed to build upon a foundation that is verified to be secure.
Operational Considerations
The outcome of this meeting dictates the start of all subsequent development work. A "No-Go" decision would require specific, actionable remediation steps to be completed before another review can be scheduled.
Verification & Validation Criteria
A DEFINITION_OF_READY_PHASE_1.md document is finalized and approved.
A formal Phase 0 Closure Review Meeting has been conducted, and all stakeholders have signed off on the completion of Phase 0.
The progress_phase_0.md log contains explicit, documented sign-offs for security, the tech stack, and the architecture.
Testing Methodologies
N/A (Process validation).
Version Control Strategy
Branching: The finalized DEFINITION_OF_READY_PHASE_1.md document is merged to develop.
Commits: The Git Commit message for this task will be exactly as specified.
Security Audit & Compliance Checkpoints

All 14 Acceptance Criteria for the Phase 0 deliverables listed below are met and have been formally signed off by the designated leads.
The progress_phase_0.md log is complete, audited, and provides a full audit trail for the entire phase.
A formal Phase 0 Closure Review Meeting has been successfully conducted, resulting in a "Go" decision to proceed to Phase 1.
Implementation Guidance
A definitive, comprehensive project blueprint and functional foundational setup for a massively scalable and security-hardened BUNKERVERSE MVE. This MVE features a Rust backend (Indexer using Elasticsearch/Typesense; Marketplace Service using Rust/Axum; other core Rust services) that interacts with L3 Smart Contracts on a sovereign Arbitrum Orbit L3 chain; integrated local AI-driven narratives (Rust NAR library wrapping Gemma3 1B via llama.cpp and a security-reviewed C-FFI), zkLogin for authentication, and a Control Center Client using Rust for core application logic integrated with a Qt (CXX-Qt) and QML-based user interface. NFTs will utilize IPFS for metadata storage. The architecture is designed to deliver MVE functionality while ensuring all future on-chain features (crypto-enabled, Netchain's evolution to a decentralized sequencer network, non-custodial options) are pre-built within the codebase but disabled via secure configuration flags. All 18 "First Principles" (A-R), especially Principle R ("Secure by Design"), are operationalized, documented, and adherence is logged. This includes:
1. Finalized & Validated Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) & Technology Choices:
Acceptance Criteria: All ADRs (covering the Arbitrum Orbit L3 architecture, Indexer with ES/TS, Marketplace with Axum, Client tech stack with Rust/CXX-Qt/QML, NAR integration with Gemma3/llama.cpp, zkLogin flow, IPFS integration for metadata) are PoC-validated. PoCs have confirmed functional suitability, MVE-scale performance viability, and security for the chosen technologies. ADRs include detailed security assessments, threat models for all critical components, and dual-mode design considerations. All ADRs are formally reviewed and approved. DEPENDENCIES.md is complete. COMPATIBILITY_MATRIX.md is up-to-date.
2. Complete, Finalized, Versioned (v0.1), & Security-Reviewed Schemas & API Contracts:
Acceptance Criteria: All Protocol Buffer schemas (for L3 smart contract events and state, and for all gRPC service DTOs), OpenAPI specifications (if any), the C-FFI header for Rust NAR (nar_ffi.h), and the Rust-QML FFI definitions are finalized, versioned (v0.1), and have undergone rigorous security reviews. These reviews include threat modeling, input validation, authN/authZ implications, FFI safety, and dual-mode field handling. All schemas fully support the lore and mechanics from BUNKERVERSE Platform Overview V2.4, including the unitary NTC token. Code generation from schemas is functional and integrated into build processes. Formal sign-off on all contracts is documented.
3. Fully Structured Monorepo with Build Systems & Monorepo Management Strategy:
Acceptance Criteria: The Git monorepo is initialized with the complete, approved directory structure (including a /contracts directory for L3 smart contracts). All Rust (Cargo), C++ (CMake), and QML projects are initialized and can be built successfully.
4. Comprehensive CI/CD Pipelines with Integrated Security Scanning:
Acceptance Criteria: All defined Phase 0 CI/CD jobs pass successfully. Crucially, integrated security scans (SAST for Rust/C++ using cargo audit, clippy, cppcheck; container vulnerability scans using Trivy) complete successfully. Any critical/high severity findings are addressed or formally risk-accepted.
5. Functional IaC for "Smart Stub" Backend with Security Baseline & Dual-Mode Configuration:
Acceptance Criteria: Smart stub versions of all backend services (including the simulated multi-layer Arbitrum Orbit L3/L2/L1 network, Indexer, Axum Marketplace, Identity, etc.) can be successfully and securely deployed to the local Docker Compose environment. The parallel-developed IaC for a future cloud Kubernetes environment is tested against a local cluster. Deployed stubs adhere to defined security baselines. Stubs correctly respond to enable_crypto configuration flags.
6. Finalized Secure Configuration Management Pattern:
Acceptance Criteria: The layered configuration pattern is implemented across components. Secure management and injection of secrets for stubs (via .env files for the local simulation) are functional. The enable_crypto and show_crypto flags are correctly loaded and defaulted to false.
7. Finalized Shared Library Interfaces & "Smart" Stubs with Secure FFI (NAR C-FFI & Client CXX-Qt FFI):
Acceptance Criteria: APIs for all shared libraries are stable and peer-reviewed. The Rust NAR C-FFI and the Client Rust-QML CXX-Qt FFI implementations incorporate all mandatory security patterns (input validation, memory management, error propagation, panic safety) and have passed FFI-specific negative tests.
8. Finalized Control Center Client Frameworks & QML UI Definition:
Acceptance Criteria: The core architectural structures for the C++ Qt Shell, the embedded Rust Application Logic, and the QML UI are stable and implemented. The CXX-Qt bridge is functional. The CLIENT_QML_UI_DEFINITION_MVE_V0.1.md document is formally signed off.
9. Comprehensive Developer Documentation including Security Protocols & New Tech Stack Details:
Acceptance Criteria: All P0 developer documentation is finalized, peer-reviewed, and validated as sufficient for onboarding developers to the P0 codebase and established processes.
10. Basic Admin CLI with "Smart Stub" Interaction:
Acceptance Criteria: The Rust Admin CLI can successfully execute its defined P0 commands against the secure smart stubs running in the local Docker Compose simulation, using secure gRPC (TLS).
11. Finalized Automated Testing Frameworks & Initial "Smart Stub" Integration Tests:
Acceptance Criteria: Testing frameworks for Rust, C++, and QML are set up and integrated into CI. All defined P0 scope unit and integration tests pass, including specific security negative tests validating error handling and input validation at API/FFI boundaries.
12. Complete & Audited Phase 0 Progress Log (docs/progress_logs/progress_phase_0.md):
Acceptance Criteria: The progress log provides a complete, meticulously detailed, and peer-reviewed audit trail for all Phase 0 activities, decisions, PoC outcomes, security assessments, and explicit verification of adherence to all 18 First Principles for each task.
13. Approved "Definition of Ready" for Phase 1 Tasks:
Acceptance Criteria: The docs/governance/DEFINITION_OF_READY_PHASE_1.md document is finalized, reviewed, and approved.
14. Formal Phase 0 Closure & Approval:
Acceptance Criteria: A formal Phase 0 Closure Review Meeting has been conducted, and all stakeholders have signed off on the completion of Phase 0, the security posture, the validated MVE technology stack, and the readiness to proceed to Phase 1.
Design Rationale
This comprehensive deliverable ensures that the project is not just conceptually sound, but is built upon a foundation of empirically validated technology, rigorously defined processes, and a security-first culture. By completing these 14 points, we have mitigated the most significant risks associated with large-scale software projects before the primary implementation phase begins.
Operational Considerations
The collection of documents and artifacts produced in Phase 0 (especially the Governance, Onboarding, and ADR documents) will serve as the "living constitution" for the project, guiding all future development and operational decisions.
Verification & Validation Criteria
The successful completion of the Phase 0 Closure Review Meeting (Task 0.14), where each of these 14 deliverables is systematically reviewed and signed off against its acceptance criteria by the relevant stakeholders.
Testing Methodologies
The validation of this overarching deliverable is primarily through process adherence, peer review, and formal sign-offs, all of which are tracked in the progress_phase_0.md log.
Version Control Strategy
All documentation and artifacts are finalized and present on the develop and main branches. The project state is tagged as v0.1.0-alpha upon completion of Phase 0.
Security Audit & Compliance Checkpoints
The Formal Phase 0 Closure & Approval (14) is the ultimate security checkpoint for this phase, requiring the mandatory sign-off of the Security Lead, who attests that the project's foundational security posture is sound and ready for Phase 1.
