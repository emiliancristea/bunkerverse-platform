Task 0.11: Developer Documentation - Initial Setup
(Comprehensive, Finalized & Reviewed for Phase 0, Reflecting All First Principles, Chosen L3 Tech Stack, Dual-Mode Strategy, & Security Workflows - Principles A-R)
Technical Reference
All documents created and finalized within Phase 0.
docs/PROJECT_GOVERNANCE_AND_WORKFLOWS.md
Context/Problem Statement
Throughout Phase 0, we have created a multitude of critical documents, from governance charters to ADRs and technology validation reports. These documents are currently in various draft states. Before proceeding to Phase 1, it is essential to consolidate, review, and finalize this entire body of knowledge into a comprehensive, accurate, and internally consistent suite of documentation. This collection will serve as the foundational knowledge base for the entire development team, accelerating onboarding and ensuring all future work is aligned with our finalized strategic and architectural decisions.
Measurable Objectives
All developer-facing documentation created in Phase 0 is finalized, peer-reviewed, and signed off.
A new, dedicated SECURE_FFI_PATTERNS.md guide is created and approved.
A successful "fresh eyes" onboarding validation exercise is conducted and its outcome is documented.
The final documentation suite accurately reflects the finalized L3 AppChain architecture, dual-mode strategy, and all PoC-validated technology choices.
Implementation Guidance
Action: Ensure all developer-facing documentation created or updated in Phase 0 is comprehensive, accurate, internally consistent, peer-reviewed, and fully reflects the chosen technology stack, the dual-mode architectural strategy, all established First Principles, and defined security workflows. This documentation serves as the foundational knowledge base for the development team.
Content Finalization & Review for Key Documents:
docs/PROJECT_GOVERNANCE_AND_WORKFLOWS.md:
Verify completeness of: Process Rigor Charter, SDL Charter, First Principles Implementation Guide, Mode Off-Chain/On-Chain Strategy, ADR Process, Dependency Management Protocol, Internal Vulnerability Reporting.
Ensure clarity, enforceability, and team understanding of all defined processes.
docs/DEVELOPMENT_ENVIRONMENT.md:
Verify accuracy and completeness of setup instructions for all chosen technologies (Rust, C++, Qt/CXX-Qt/QML, Docker Desktop, local Arbitrum Orbit L3 node setup tooling, etc.) and local security tools.
Confirm pinned versions are correct and match COMPATIBILITY_MATRIX.md.
docs/ADR/ (All ADRs including the new L3 framework choice):
Verify all ADRs for finalized technology choices (Arbitrum Orbit L3, Indexer with ES/TS, Marketplace with Axum, Client with Rust/CXX-Qt/QML, NAR with Gemma3/llama.cpp, zkLogin) are updated with PoC results, justifications, detailed security considerations, threat model outlines, and dual-mode design implications.
Ensure ADRs are approved and versioned.
DEPENDENCIES.md:
Verify it lists all chosen external dependencies for the MVE tech stack with pinned versions, licenses, justifications, and security assessment summaries.
COMPATIBILITY_MATRIX.md:
Verify it documents known compatible versions for all critical cross-language or cross-component dependencies.
/protos/ Schemas & API Contract Documentation (Generated HTML & Readmes):
Verify all Protobuf schemas and gRPC/OpenAPI service definitions are finalized, versioned (v0.1), and accurately reflect the MVE scope including dual-mode fields.
Ensure generated HTML documentation is up-to-date and accessible.
nar_ffi.h (for NAR C-FFI) and documentation for Rust functions exposed via CXX-Qt to QML must clearly explain usage, parameters, error handling, and memory management contracts.
docs/TESTING_STRATEGY.md:
Verify the initial outline covers all test types and environments, explicitly addressing testing for the dual-mode architecture and the new technology stack.
docs/SMART_STUBS_SPECIFICATION.md:
Verify it clearly defines how smart stubs should behave, including dual-mode configuration.
docs/SMART_CONTRACT_EVOLUTION_PLAN.md:
Verify the initial strategy for L3 smart contract schema versioning and upgradeability is documented.
docs/operations/PRODUCTION_ROLLBACK_PROCEDURE.md (Initial Draft):
Outline basic rollback considerations for application code and database schemas.
docs/INCIDENT_RESPONSE_PLAN_DRAFT.md:
Verify initial outline for incident response is in place.
Secure FFI Patterns Documentation (New Document):
Create a dedicated document docs/developer_guides/SECURE_FFI_PATTERNS.md detailing best practices for:
Rust NAR C-FFI: Secure string handling, struct validation, memory management, error propagation, panic safety. Provide code examples.
Rust-QML CXX-Qt FFI: Secure data passing from QML to Rust, Rust error propagation to QML, panic safety, CXX-Qt specific considerations for memory and object lifetime. Provide code examples.
Review Process:
Each key document owner is responsible for ensuring their document is up-to-date and accurate.
A final review pass by relevant leads (Tech Leads, Architect, Security Lead, PM) for consistency, clarity, and completeness.
Onboarding Validation: A team member (ideally newer to the project or a designated "fresh eyes" reviewer) attempts to set up their development environment and understand core concepts solely using the finalized P0 documentation. Feedback from this process is incorporated.
Update docs/progress_logs/progress_phase_0.md:
List all key P0 documents and confirm their final review and sign-off.
Specifically note the creation and content of the SECURE_FFI_PATTERNS.md guide.
Document the outcome of the onboarding validation exercise (e.g., "New developer successfully set up the local Docker Compose simulation for the Arbitrum Orbit L3, L2, and L1 nodes and backend services using P0 documentation. Minor clarifications added to DEVELOPMENT_ENVIRONMENT.md based on feedback.").
Design Rationale
Excellent documentation is a force multiplier. It accelerates onboarding, reduces errors by creating a single source of truth, and ensures that the high standards set in Phase 0 are maintained throughout the project's lifecycle. The "fresh eyes" validation is a crucial step to test the clarity and completeness of the documentation, simulating the experience of a new hire.
Operational Considerations
This documentation suite will be the foundation for all future development. It will be the first resource for new team members and the canonical reference for architectural and process decisions. It must be kept up-to-date as the project evolves.
Verification & Validation Criteria
Successful completion of peer reviews for all listed documents.
Positive outcome of the "fresh eyes" onboarding validation exercise, with any necessary clarifications added to the documentation.
All linked documents in the progress log are in their finalized P0 state and signed off by the designated reviewers.
Testing Methodologies
N/A (Documentation review and process validation).
Version Control Strategy
Branching: All documentation updates will be made on feature/ branches and merged into develop.
Commits: The Git Commit message for this task will be exactly as specified.
Security Audit & Compliance Checkpoints
The Security Lead must perform a final review and sign-off on all security-related documentation, including the SDL Charter, Incident Response Plan, and the Secure FFI Patterns guide.
ReviewedBy: Lead Architect, Project Manager, Security Lead, All Tech Leads, Technical Writer (if applicable).
ReviewOutcome: Phase 0 Developer Documentation Suite (Reflecting Full L3 Tech Stack, Dual-Mode Strategy, Security Protocols, and Secure FFI Patterns) Approved.
ValidationMethod: Successful completion of documentation peer reviews. Positive outcome of the onboarding validation exercise. All linked documents are in their finalized P0 state.
