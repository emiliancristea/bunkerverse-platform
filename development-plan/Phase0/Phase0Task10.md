## Task 0.10: Control Center Client - QML UI Definition
(Finalized Document & Formal Review for QML Interface - Principles P, R)

### Technical Reference
 UI/UX Wireframes and Mockups
 Finalized v0.1 API Contracts (from Task 0.3)
 docs/PROJECT_GOVERNANCE_AND_WORKFLOWS.md (Process Rigor Charter)

### Context/Problem Statement
With the client's technical framework in place, we must now create the definitive blueprint for the user interface itself. Before intensive UI development begins, the entire MVE user flow, screen layouts, and component designs must be formally documented and approved by all stakeholders. This prevents wasted engineering effort, ensures a cohesive and high-quality user experience, and aligns the frontend implementation with the backend's capabilities and the project's overall vision.
### Measurable Objectives
 A comprehensive UI definition document, docs/ui/CLIENT_QML_UI_DEFINITION_MVE_V0.1.md, is created, detailing the full scope of the MVE client UI.
 The document undergoes a formal, minuted review with all relevant stakeholders.
 The document is formally signed off on, becoming the canonical source of truth for all subsequent QML development.

### Implementation Guidance
Action: Create a comprehensive UI definition document specifically for the Control Center Client's QML-based interface. This document will detail all screens, components, user flows, and interactions for the MVE scope. Conduct a formal review and obtain sign-off from all relevant stakeholders.

#### QML UI Definition Document Content (docs/ui/CLIENT_QML_UI_DEFINITION_MVE_V0.1.md):
 Overall Application Structure & Navigation:
 Define the main application layout (e.g., persistent header, main content area).
 Detail the two primary navigation systems:
 The Main Interface ("VERSE"): Detail the primary horizontal navigation bar with its four tabs: THE NEXUS, THE PLAZA, THE CONSTRUCTS, THE GUARD. Detail the sub-tabs within each (e.g., CAMP, ARCADE, ARCHIVES under THE NEXUS).
 The Right-Click Logo Menu (Interface Switcher): Detail the functionality of the right-click menu on the BUNKERVERSE logo, which switches the entire client UI between the VERSE and SOCIAL interfaces. Note that STREAMING and HARDWARE are locked placeholders.
 Illustrate the hierarchy of screens and views.
 Screen-by-Screen Wireframes & Component Breakdown (for MVE Scope): For each MVE screen:
 Purpose: Briefly describe the screen's function.
 Wireframe/Mockup: Include a low-fidelity wireframe or high-fidelity mockup illustrating layout and key elements.
 QML Components: List the primary QML components to be used/developed for this screen (e.g., ListView, GridView, StyledButton, NarDisplayArea.qml).
 Data Displayed: Specify what data (from the Rust rustBackend QObject properties) is displayed on this screen and how (e.g., "Player's BunkerTag displayed in Header", "List of owned NFTs in Guard Inventory, showing item icon, name, rarity, type").
 User Interactions & Rust Backend Calls: Detail all user interactions (button clicks, form submissions) and which #[cxx_qt::qinvokable] Rust methods on rustBackend they trigger. Specify parameters passed from QML to Rust.
 State Changes & QML Updates: Describe how the UI updates in response to signals from rustBackend (e.g., "When rustBackend.marketplaceListingsChanged signal is emitted, the Marketplace ListView re-populates").
 Error Handling Display: How are errors (from Rust backend calls or NAR FFI) presented to the user on this screen (e.g., using ErrorMessage.qml)?
 Dual-Mode UI Considerations (show_crypto: false for MVE): For each screen, explicitly state which UI elements or sections are related to Mode On-Chain features (e.g., the EXCHANGE tab) and will be hidden/disabled when show_crypto is false.
 Reusable QML Component Specifications:
 Detailed specifications for common reusable QML components (identified in P0.8), including their properties, signals, and methods.
 NAR Narrative Display Integration:
 Specify where and how Rust NAR-generated narratives will be displayed across different UI sections (e.g., dedicated panel in Guard UI logs, pop-up notifications for achievements, integrated into post-game summaries).
 Define requirements for the QML component responsible for displaying NAR narratives.
 Accessibility Considerations (QML):
 Outline initial accessibility goals for the MVE QML UI (e.g., keyboard navigability, color contrast guidelines from Style.qml).
 Styling & Theme Guide (Reference to Style.qml):
 Reference the QML style guide or Style.qml singleton for colors, typography, spacing.
 Formal Review Meeting & Sign-off:
 Attendees: UI/UX Lead, Client Lead (Rust & QML), Lead Architect, Product Owner, QA Lead, Security Lead (to review any security implications of UI design, e.g., data display, input methods).
 Process: Walk through the UI Definition Document section by section. Discuss feasibility, consistency, user experience, and alignment with MVE goals and the dual-mode strategy.
 Outcome: Formal sign-off on the CLIENT_QML_UI_DEFINITION_MVE_V0.1.md document, or a list of required revisions.
#### Update docs/progress_logs/progress_phase_0.md:
 Log the creation and finalization of docs/ui/CLIENT_QML_UI_DEFINITION_MVE_V0.1.md.
 Record the date of the formal review meeting, attendees, and the sign-off outcome. Link to the signed-off document version.
### Design Rationale
This document acts as the definitive "blueprint" for the UI developers. It ensures that the UI/UX vision is translated into a concrete technical plan that is feasible and aligned with the backend capabilities before any significant implementation work begins. Formally documenting the final UI structure, including all tabs and interfaces, prevents scope creep and ensures a cohesive product.
### Operational Considerations
This signed-off document will be the primary reference for all QML implementation tasks in subsequent phases. Any proposed deviation from this document will require a formal review and approval process, likely involving an update to the document itself.
### Verification & Validation Criteria
 A formal sign-off on the UI Definition Document by all designated reviewers is achieved and documented.
 The document accurately and completely reflects the planned MVE QML UI, including all specified navigation tabs and interfaces.
### Testing Methodologies
N/A (Document creation and review). QA Lead will use this document to create their E2E test plans in later phases.
### Version Control Strategy
 Branching: The document will be created and iterated upon in a feature/ branch.
 Commits: The Git Commit message for this task will be exactly as specified.
### Security Audit & Compliance Checkpoints
 The Security Lead's attendance and sign-off at the formal review meeting are mandatory.
 The review must cover any potential for the UI design to inadvertently expose sensitive data or create insecure user flows.
 The plan for hiding/disabling Mode On-Chain features in the UI must be explicitly reviewed and approved.
ReviewedBy: UI/UX Lead, Client Lead (Rust & QML), Lead Architect, Product Owner, QA Lead, Security Lead.
ReviewOutcome: Control Center Client QML UI Definition MVE v0.1 Approved and Signed Off.
ValidationMethod: Formal sign-off on the UI Definition Document by all designated reviewers. Document accurately reflects the planned MVE QML UI.
