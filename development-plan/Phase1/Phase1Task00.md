Initial Task for Phase 1:
(1.0) Create Phase 1 Progress Log & Review Phase 0 Deliverables / Phase 1 DoR Verification
(Security Focus, Tech Stack Validation, MVE Confirmation)
Technical Reference
docs/progress_logs/progress_phase_0.md (as the source for the review)
docs/governance/DEFINITION_OF_READY_PHASE_1.md (as the checklist)
All Phase 0 Deliverable documents
Context/Problem Statement
We are at the critical juncture between planning and execution. The successful completion of Phase 0 provided a comprehensive blueprint, but before committing resources to implementation, we must formally verify that every foundational deliverable is complete, signed-off, and meets its acceptance criteria. This task serves as the final gate, ensuring the entire team is aligned and begins Phase 1 from a shared, stable, and secure starting point.
Measurable Objectives
A docs/progress_logs/progress_phase_1.md file is created with the correct structure.
A Phase 1 kickoff meeting is successfully conducted and its minutes are documented.
All 14 deliverables from the Phase 0 Deliverable section are formally reviewed and signed off against the DEFINITION_OF_READY_PHASE_1.md checklist.
A formal "Phase 1 Initiated" outcome is declared and logged by the Project Manager and Lead Architect.
Implementation Guidance
Action:
Create the file docs/progress_logs/progress_phase_1.md using the same detailed structure as progress_phase_0.md.
Conduct a Phase 1 kickoff meeting with all relevant team members.
Formally review all Phase 0 deliverables against their acceptance criteria. This includes:
Finalized ADRs and validated technology choices (Arbitrum Orbit, Axum, CXX-Qt/QML, Gemma3/llama.cpp, ES/TS).
Complete, versioned (v0.1), and security-reviewed schemas & API contracts (including dual-mode fields).
Functional CI/CD pipelines with integrated security scanning for the chosen tech stack.
Functional IaC for smart stubs (configurable for dual-mode) running in the local Docker Compose simulation.
Finalized secure configuration management pattern.
Finalized shared library interfaces & secure FFI implementations.
Finalized CC Client QML UI definition and framework setup.
Comprehensive P0 developer documentation.
Functional Admin CLI for service stubs.
Initial automated testing setup with security-aware tests.
Completed docs/progress_logs/progress_phase_0.md audit trail.
Explicitly verify that all "Definition of Ready" criteria for commencing Phase 1 tasks (from docs/governance/DEFINITION_OF_READY_PHASE_1.md) are met and signed off by relevant leads. This includes confirming readiness of security measures, full schema definitions for P1 scope (especially UserRegisteredPayloadProto with default ActiveBunkerguardDataProto), and clarity on implementing MVE functionality first, with future on-chain features present in schemas/APIs but logically disabled.
Update docs/progress_logs/progress_phase_1.md: Log the creation of this file, the kickoff meeting agenda and minutes, and formal confirmation of Phase 1 readiness based on the detailed DoR checklist from P0.14. Explicitly note the sign-off on P0 deliverables and the team's preparedness to implement P1 tasks using the validated tech stack (Arbitrum Orbit, Axum, CXX-Qt/QML, etc.) and dual-mode strategy.
Design Rationale
A formal kickoff and DoR verification prevents misalignment and technical debt. By ensuring every developer starts Phase 1 with the same understanding of the finalized architecture, schemas, and security requirements, we drastically reduce the risk of building incompatible components or having to perform costly refactoring later.
Operational Considerations
The progress_phase_1.md log, created here, will become the single source of truth for the status and history of this entire phase. All subsequent task completions in Phase 1 will be validated against the criteria established in the DoR document.
Verification & Validation Criteria
Kickoff Meeting Minutes are recorded, approved, and linked in the progress log.
The Phase 0 Deliverable Checklist is formally signed-off by all required leads, item by item.
The Phase 1 DoR Checklist is verified and signed-off by all required leads.
Testing Methodologies
N/A (Process verification).
Version Control Strategy
Branching: The progress_phase_1.md file is created on a feature/ branch (e.g., feature/phase-1-setup).
Commits: The Git Commit message for this task will be exactly as specified, once the meeting is complete and the log is populated.
Security Audit & Compliance Checkpoints
The Security Lead's formal sign-off on the completion of all Phase 0 security deliverables is a mandatory condition for passing this task's review. This confirms the project enters the implementation phase with a secure foundation.
ReviewedBy: Project Manager, Lead Architect, All Tech Leads (L3 Smart Contracts, Indexer, Marketplace, Identity, AI, Mission, Social, Payment, Client Rust/QML, C++ Game Dev Stubs), QA Lead, SRE/DevOps Lead, Security Lead, Game Design Lead.
ReviewOutcome: Phase 1 Initiated (Full Schema Support for P1 Defaults, Validated Tech Stack, MVE Focus Confirmed).
ValidationMethod: Kickoff Meeting Minutes recorded. Phase 0 Deliverable Checklist formally signed-off. Phase 1 DoR Checklist verified and signed-off by all required leads.
