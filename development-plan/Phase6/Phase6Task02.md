Task 6.2: C++ Control Center Client - Final UI/UX Polish, Optimization, Accessibility, and Production Build Packaging
(Principles P, O, Q, R)
Technical Reference
* docs/ui/CLIENT_QML_UI_DEFINITION_MVE_V0.1.md
* Platform-specific accessibility guidelines (WCAG, platform guides)
* Platform-specific code signing and installer creation tools (WiX Toolset, codesign, notarytool)
* Finalized v0.9.9-stable internal build from Task 6.1
Context/Problem Statement
The Control Center client is now stable and feature-complete for the MVE scope. However, to be ready for a public launch, it must be elevated from a functional application to a polished, professional-grade product. This involves a final UI/UX polish pass, performance optimization for low-end hardware, implementation of accessibility features, and the creation of secure, robust, signed installers for all target operating systems, including a critical security feature for downloading the AI model on first launch.
Measurable Objectives
* All MVE UI screens are polished to a "pixel-perfect" state, matching the final design language.
* The client meets defined performance and responsiveness targets on the specified min-spec hardware.
* All MVE-scope accessibility features are implemented and validated.
* Production-ready, signed, and (where applicable) notarized installers for Windows, macOS, and Linux are created and successfully tested.
* The secure NAR model download handler is fully functional and tested.
Implementation Guidance
Action: Complete all final UI/UX polish, performance optimizations, and MVE-scope accessibility improvements for the Control Center Client. Create production-ready, signed, and notarized installers for all target platforms, including a fully functional and tested Rust NAR model download handler.
* Implementation Details:
o UI/UX Polish: Conduct a final design review and implement pixel-level polish for all QML UI screens and components. Ensure perfect adherence to the finalized design language, including animations, transitions, and visual feedback. Address any remaining usability friction identified in P5 testing.
o Performance Optimization: Profile the client on min-spec hardware. Optimize QML bindings, reduce component complexity where possible, and optimize any performance-critical Rust application logic to meet UI responsiveness targets (e.g., sub-100ms response to user interaction).
o Accessibility (MVE Scope): Implement and test all planned MVE accessibility features: full keyboard navigation for all interactive elements, sufficient color contrast across all themes, screen reader compatibility (e.g., using Accessible attached properties in QML) for key UI text and all NAR narratives. Validate with platform-native tools (e.g., VoiceOver on macOS, NVDA on Windows).
o Production Installers & Auto-Updater:
* Finalize installer scripts for Windows (generating a signed .exe using WiX), macOS (generating a signed and notarized .dmg), and Linux (generating an .AppImage).
* The installers must robustly bundle the C++ application shell, the Rust application logic library, the Rust NAR library, all necessary QML files and assets, and all runtime dependencies (llama.cpp, Qt).
* Functional nar-model-handler (Rust logic):
* On first run, it securely (HTTPS) downloads the pinned Gemma3 1B GGUF model from the production CDN.
* It displays clear download progress and error messages within the client UI.
* It must perform a SHA256 checksum verification of the downloaded model file against a known-good checksum (fetched from a secure config endpoint or bundled). It will fail and prompt the user if there is a mismatch.
* It handles download errors gracefully (e.g., retries, user notification).
* Basic Version Check: The client will call a simple version check API on startup. If a new version is available, it will display a non-blocking notification prompting the user to download the new version from the official website.
* Update docs/progress_logs/progress_phase_6.md:
o Log the final UI/UX polish changes.
o Document client performance metrics on min-spec hardware.
o Detail the accessibility features implemented and tested.
o Describe the robust NAR model download handler.
Design Rationale
A polished and performant client is critical for a user's first impression and long-term retention. Securely signed and notarized installers are a non-negotiable trust and security signal for users. A robust model downloader with checksum verification is a critical security measure to prevent supply-chain attacks where a malicious AI model could be distributed to users, and it also ensures a good user experience for those with slow or unstable connections.
Operational Considerations
1. Local-First: All installer builds will be generated and tested within the CI/CD pipeline running in the local environment first. The NAR model downloader will be tested against a local minio S3-compatible server running in Docker Compose.
2. Cloud-Ready: The production CI/CD pipeline will be enhanced with secure secrets (code-signing certificates) to automate the signing and notarization process for release builds. The nar-model-handler and the version check API will point to production CDN and API endpoints.
Verification & Validation Criteria
* Formal sign-off from the UI/UX Lead on the final client polish.
* Successful installation, NAR model download/validation, and uninstallation on clean VMs for all target OSes (Windows 11, latest macOS, Ubuntu LTS).
* The MVE-scope accessibility checklist is fully passed and validated.
Testing Methodologies
* Manual QA: Extensive manual testing of the final UI polish, performance on min-spec hardware, and accessibility features.
* Installation Testing: Scripted tests for installing, running, and uninstalling the application on clean virtual machines for each target OS.
* Security Testing: The NAR model downloader's security (HTTPS enforcement, checksum verification) will be a specific focus of security testing.
Version Control Strategy
* Branching: All polish, optimization, and packaging work will be done on the release/mve-0.9 branch.
* Commits: The Git Commit message for this task will be exactly as specified.
Security Audit & Compliance Checkpoints
* The Security Lead must review and approve the production installer and code-signing process.
* The NAR model download handler is a critical security feature and must undergo a security review to ensure it cannot be bypassed and that it correctly validates the model's integrity.
ReviewedBy: UI/UX Lead, Client Lead (Rust & QML), QA Lead, DevOps Lead, Security Lead (for installer & model download security).
ReviewOutcome: Client Polish, Accessibility (MVE), & Packaging Approved.
ValidationMethod: Formal sign-off from UI/UX. Successful installation, NAR model download/validation, and uninstallation on clean VMs for all target OSes. Accessibility checklist for MVE scope passed.
