Context/Problem Statement
While security has been an integrated, continuous process throughout development, a final, dedicated, top-to-bottom security review is required before the MVE can be deemed ready for launch. This is a holistic assessment of the entire system in its near-production state, conducted by the internal team. It is designed to catch any gaps, regressions, or misconfigurations that may have slipped through previous checks. It also serves as the formal preparation for any future external security audits or penetration tests.
Measurable Objectives
* A final, comprehensive internal security review of all production configurations, code, and infrastructure is completed and documented.
* All critical/high severity findings from final SAST, DAST, and container vulnerability scans are remediated or formally risk-accepted.
* The project's Incident Response Plan is finalized to v1.0 and approved by all stakeholders.
* A comprehensive briefing package for a potential future external penetration test is prepared.
Implementation Guidance
Action: Conduct a final, comprehensive internal security hardening pass and vulnerability assessment on the complete, production-configured MVE stack. Prepare all necessary documentation and environments for a potential external penetration test.
* Implementation Details:
o Final Internal Security Review:
* A systematic review by the Security Lead and all tech leads of the final production configurations (Terraform, K8s, service configs), final code, and all security controls implemented throughout the project.
* Run final SAST (cargo audit), DAST (against staging APIs), and container vulnerability scans (Trivy) on the exact production-candidate builds and images. All critical/high findings must be remediated or formally risk-accepted with documented mitigations.
* Final review of production IaC for IAM, Security Groups, and K8s RBAC/NetworkPolicies.
* Verify that all production secrets are securely managed in their designated secret management solution with appropriate access policies.
o Documentation for External Penetration Test:
* Compile a comprehensive "External Penetration Test Briefing Package" document, including MVE architecture overview, key API documentation, network diagrams, and scope of the test.
o Incident Response Plan v1.0:
* Finalize the incident response plan, including escalation paths for security incidents, communication plans, and forensic data collection steps.
* Update docs/progress_logs/progress_phase_6.md:
o Log all final internal security hardening activities.
o Document the results of the final security scans (e.g., "Trivy scan on v1.0.0 image found 0 critical/high vulnerabilities").
o Link to the finalized Incident Response Plan v1.0 and the Pen Test Briefing Package draft.
Design Rationale
A final, holistic internal security review is the last line of defense before exposing the system to potentially hostile external actors. It catches systemic issues and misconfigurations that might be missed when looking at individual components. Finalizing the Incident Response Plan ensures that the team is not just prepared to prevent incidents, but is also drilled and ready to react to them in a calm, orderly, and effective manner. Preparing the penetration test package in advance saves valuable time when an external audit is commissioned.
Operational Considerations
* Local-First & Cloud-Ready: This review covers both the application code (developed locally) and the Infrastructure-as-Code (developed for the cloud). The DAST scans will be run against the services deployed in the local Docker Compose simulation or a dedicated, production-like staging environment.
* Post-Launch: The Incident Response Plan v1.0 will be the live document used to handle any security incidents that occur after launch. The Penetration Test Briefing Package will be provided to any third-party security firm we engage.
Verification & Validation Criteria
* All security review checklists are completed and signed off by the relevant leads.
* All identified critical/high vulnerabilities from final scans are remediated, with proof of remediation (e.g., a linked PR).
* The Incident Response Plan v1.0 is formally approved by all stakeholders.
Testing Methodologies
* Static Application Security Testing (SAST): Using tools like cargo audit on final build artifacts.
* Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST): Using tools like OWASP ZAP to scan the live APIs on the staging environment for common web vulnerabilities.
* Software Composition Analysis (SCA): Using tools like Trivy on the final Docker images.
* Manual Review: Manual code and configuration review by the Security Lead and other tech leads.
Version Control Strategy
* Branching: Any required code remediations will be done in hotfix/ branches and merged into the release/mve-0.9 (or main) branch. Documentation will be updated in a feature/security-hardening-final branch.
* Commits: The Git Commit message for this task will be exactly as specified.
Security Audit & Compliance Checkpoints
This entire task is a mandatory security gate for the project. Its successful completion and the formal sign-off from the Security Lead are non-negotiable prerequisites for proceeding to the final internal acceptance testing and any subsequent external testing.
ReviewedBy: Security Lead, Lead Architect, All Tech Leads.
ReviewOutcome: MVE Final Internal Security Review & Hardening Approved for Launch.
ValidationMethod: Security review checklists completed and signed off. All critical/high vulnerabilities from final scans are remediated. Incident Response Plan v1.0 is approved.
