Initial Task for Phase 6:
* (6.0) Create Phase 6 Progress Log & Review Phase 5 Deliverables / Phase 6 DoR Verification
(Security, Performance & Production Readiness Focus for MVE)
Technical Reference
o docs/progress_logs/progress_phase_5.md
o Phase 5 Deliverable documentation
o docs/PROJECT_GOVERNANCE_AND_WORKFLOWS.md (SDL Charter for P6)
Context/Problem Statement
Phase 5 delivered a feature-complete MVE platform. The project now enters its final and most critical hardening and stabilization period before any public exposure. The focus must shift entirely from building new features to perfecting and securing what has been built. This kickoff task is essential to formally cease all feature development, align the entire team on the singular goal of production readiness, and verify that the platform is stable enough to begin this intensive phase of testing and hardening.
Measurable Objectives
1. A docs/progress_logs/progress_phase_6.md file is created.
2. A Phase 6 kickoff meeting is successfully conducted, and all leads formally agree to and sign off on the MVE feature freeze.
3. The P6 "Definition of Ready" (DoR) is verified against the completed P5 deliverables.
Implementation Guidance
Action:
o Create docs/progress_logs/progress_phase_6.md with the same detailed structure, emphasizing security validation checklists, performance metric reports, and operational readiness verification.
o Conduct a Phase 6 kickoff meeting. Formally review all Phase 5 deliverables (fully functional and integrated Rust Mission Service; performance-tuned backend; compelling Rust NAR platform narratives; fully functional C++ CC UI for all platform loops).
o Verify Phase 6 "Definition of Ready" (DoR) criteria are met:
i. All P5 E2E tests are passing, including security scenarios.
ii. The MVE is declared feature-complete for its platform launch scope.
iii. Initial performance baselines under mixed load are documented from P5.2.
iv. The local Docker Compose simulation environment is stable and has been used for P5 testing.
v. The production-ready IaC (Terraform, Kubernetes manifests) is drafted and ready for finalization.
o Review PROJECT_GOVERNANCE_AND_WORKFLOWS.MD for SDL activities in P6 (final internal security audits, penetration testing preparation, production deployment security checklists, incident response plan finalization).
Update docs/progress_logs/progress_phase_6.md: Log the creation of this file, the kickoff, and formal confirmation of P6 readiness. Explicitly confirm the project is now in a feature-frozen state, focused exclusively on hardening, polish, and operational readiness.
Design Rationale
A feature freeze is a non-negotiable prerequisite for stabilization. It prevents "scope creep" and allows the QA and SRE teams to test against a stable target, which is essential for identifying and resolving the most difficult bugs. This formal kickoff ensures a clean break from feature development and a unified focus on quality and production readiness.
Operational Considerations
The progress_phase_6.md log will be the single source of truth for this phase. The feature freeze must be strictly enforced through the project's governance process; any proposed change must be rejected unless it is a P0/P1 bug fix.
Verification & Validation Criteria
o Kickoff Meeting Minutes are recorded and approved.
o The Phase 5 Deliverable Checklist is formally signed off.
o The Phase 6 DoR Checklist is verified and signed off by all required leads.
Testing Methodologies
N/A (Process verification).
Version Control Strategy
o Branching: A release/mve-0.9 branch may be created from develop to signify the feature freeze. Only bug fixes approved in triage will be merged into this branch.
o Commits: The Git Commit message for this task will be exactly as specified.
Security Audit & Compliance Checkpoints
o The Security Lead's formal sign-off on the completion of all Phase 5 security deliverables and approval of the Phase 6 security plan (final audits, hardening sprints) is a mandatory condition for passing this task's review.
ReviewedBy: Project Manager, Lead Architect, All Tech Leads, QA Lead, SRE/DevOps Lead, Community Lead, Security Lead.
ReviewOutcome: Phase 6 Initiated (Production Hardening & Validation Phase Confirmed).
ValidationMethod: Kickoff Meeting Minutes recorded. P5 Deliverables Verified. P6 DoR Checklist Confirmed.
