Context/Problem Statement
While the MVE application has been built and tested in a local-first simulation, the infrastructure, deployment pipelines, and operational procedures for a real-world, scalable cloud environment have only been developed in parallel. Before we can consider the project launch-ready, we must finalize, harden, and validate all of this production-grade machinery. This task involves translating all the hardened staging configurations and operational plans into their final production-ready state and validating them through rigorous testing and drills.
Measurable Objectives
Finalized, security-audited, production-grade Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) for the cloud environment is complete and validated.
The production CI/CD deployment pipeline, including a mandatory manual approval gate, is finalized and tested against a staging environment.
A production-grade monitoring and alerting system is deployed and validated end-to-end with a successful alert test.
A full Disaster Recovery (DR) drill is successfully completed, with measured RTO/RPO meeting defined targets.
Implementation Guidance
Action: Finalize all production Infrastructure-as-Code, CI/CD deployment pipelines, monitoring/alerting configurations, and operational procedures like backup/restore. This involves translating all the hardened configurations developed for the local simulation into their final production-ready state and validating them.
Implementation Details:
o Production IaC Finalization (/infra/terraform/production/, /infra/k8s/production/):
Finalize the production Terraform scripts (EKS node groups sized for launch load + buffer, Production RDS/ElastiCache with HA, Production ALBs with AWS WAF, Production S3 policies).
Finalize production Kubernetes manifests/Helm charts (replica counts, resource requests/limits, liveness/readiness probes, hardened NetworkPolicies, Pod Security Standards).
Internal IaC Security Audit: The Security and SRE leads conduct a final, line-by-line review of all production IaC, verifying least privilege, restrictive network rules, and secure configurations.
o Production CI/CD Pipeline Finalization (.github/workflows/*.yml):
Finalize the production deployment stages. These must trigger only from a protected main branch or specific release tags (e.g., v1.0.0).
Implement a mandatory manual approval gate in the pipeline before any deployment to the production environment, requiring sign-off from designated personnel (e.g., SRE Lead).
Finalize and test the documented production rollback procedure in the staging environment.
o Production Monitoring & Alerting Finalization (Prometheus, Grafana, Alertmanager, CloudWatch):
Deploy production instances of all monitoring tools.
Recreate all key Grafana dashboards, pointing to production data sources.
Configure Alertmanager to route P0/P1 alerts to the designated on-call team via PagerDuty/OpsGenie.
End-to-End Alert Test: Manually trigger a P0 test alert from the production monitoring system to verify the entire notification pipeline to on-call personnel works correctly.
o Production Backup & Restore Strategy Finalization:
Implement and enable the automated, scheduled backup procedures for all production data stores (L3 sequencer state, Indexer ES snapshots to S3, MySQL RDS snapshots, Redis RDB snapshots).
Conduct one final, full Disaster Recovery (DR) drill, restoring a set of production-grade backups (from the staging environment) to a separate, temporary DR environment. Verify data integrity and core MVE functionality post-restore, measuring the actual RTO and RPO.
Update docs/progress_logs/progress_phase_6.md:
o Log the final configurations for production IaC, CI/CD, monitoring, and backup. Document the outcomes of the IaC security audit, the successful production alert test, and the full DR drill (including measured RTO/RPO).
Design Rationale
This task translates our "Cloud-Ready" architecture into a "Cloud-Proven" operational reality. Finalizing Infrastructure-as-Code makes our production environment auditable, repeatable, and scalable. A mandatory manual approval gate in the CI/CD pipeline is a critical safety control to prevent accidental or unauthorized deployments. A fully drilled and documented DR plan is the only way to be genuinely prepared for a catastrophic failure, transforming a potential disaster into a manageable incident.
Operational Considerations
Local-First vs. Cloud: This task is the primary bridge from our local development model to the cloud. While the application code remains the same, the operational wrapper (IaC, CI/CD, Monitoring) is what makes it run securely and reliably at scale.
Cost: The finalized IaC will provide the most accurate estimate of the MVE's monthly cloud hosting costs.
Security: The IaC security audit is a critical checkpoint to ensure that the secure patterns developed locally are not undermined by misconfigurations in the cloud environment.
Verification & Validation Criteria
Successful production IaC dry-runs (terraform plan) show no errors.
Successful deployment to a production-like staging environment via the finalized CI/CD pipeline, including a successful manual approval step.
A successful E2E alert test is confirmed by the on-call lead.
A successful DR drill is completed and formally signed off by the SRE/DevOps and Lead Architect.
Testing Methodologies
Deployment Testing: Deploying the full stack to a staging environment using the finalized production pipeline.
Disaster Recovery Testing: A full, scripted DR drill involving the restoration of all data backends.
Alerting Tests: Manually triggering alerts to validate the full notification pipeline.
Version Control Strategy
Branching: All IaC and CI/CD changes will be developed on a feature/production-readiness branch.
Commits: The Git Commit message for this task will be exactly as specified.
Security Audit & Compliance Checkpoints
The final, line-by-line security audit of all production IaC is a mandatory sign-off from the Security Lead.
The configuration of the monitoring and alerting system for security-related events must be reviewed and approved.
The backup and restore strategy must be reviewed to ensure it is secure (e.g., backups are encrypted, access to backups is tightly controlled).
ReviewedBy: SRE/DevOps Lead, Security Lead, Lead Architect, QA Lead.
ReviewOutcome: Production Operations & Infrastructure Plans Approved and Validated.
ValidationMethod: Successful production IaC dry-runs. Successful E2E alert test. Successful DR drill signed off.
