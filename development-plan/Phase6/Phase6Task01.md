Context/Problem Statement
The MVE is now feature-complete, but the rapid development required to reach this stage has inevitably introduced a range of bugs and potential stability issues. Before the platform can be considered for any public release, it must undergo a rigorous hardening period. With the feature freeze in effect, the entire team's focus shifts from building new features to a dedicated, systematic effort to find, prioritize, and fix all remaining critical issues, thereby enhancing overall system stability and quality to a production-grade level.
Measurable Objectives
A strict MVE feature freeze is successfully enforced.
The project's issue tracker shows zero open P0 (Blocker) and P1 (Critical/High) bugs related to the MVE platform scope by the end of the task.
The system is proven to be stable under long-duration (48hr+) soak tests.
The system demonstrates resilience to fault injection (chaos testing) in the local simulation.
A final QA and Narrative Design sign-off on the quality and consistency of the NAR is achieved.
Implementation Guidance
Action: Enforce a strict MVE feature freeze: no new features or significant refactors are permitted. Dedicate focused development sprints exclusively to fixing all remaining P0 (Blocker) and P1 (Critical/High) bugs, enhancing system stability, and hardening all components based on issues found in late Phase 5 testing and new, comprehensive QA passes in this phase.
Comprehensive QA Cycles (on Production-Candidate Builds): The QA team will execute the full regression test suite (manual and automated) on production-candidate builds deployed to the local Docker Compose simulation environment. The testing focus will expand to include long-duration soak tests and fault injection.
o L3 Smart Contracts & Backend: Run long-duration (48hr+) data integrity tests under mixed platform load. Use chaos engineering principles to test fault injection: kill a database container (MySQL/Redis), kill an Indexer node, sever network links between services in the Docker network. Verify the system remains stable and that failed components recover correctly without data corruption. Verify the accuracy of all 12 BunkerClass and 3 ClassAffiliation dynamic calculations under all GDD-defined edge cases.
o Rust Indexer: Run data consistency validation scripts that compare a sample of records from the live Indexer against the source of truth read directly from the L3 Smart Contracts. Test the Indexer's recovery and re-sync speed after a prolonged outage of its connection to the L3 event stream.
o Rust Platform Services: Test robustness of all APIs under high concurrent load and with fuzzed/erroneous inputs. Test the Stripe integration with all documented Stripe error responses and webhook edge cases.
o C++ Control Center Client & Rust NAR: Test UI stability, performance, and memory usage over long sessions on the target Windows 11 machine. Validate the zkLogin flow for all providers under flaky network conditions. Test the Rust NAR (llama.cpp via FFI) for memory leaks and ensure consistent performance during continuous narrative generation.
Narrative Coherence & Quality Assurance (Final Polish): A final, comprehensive review of Rust NAR narratives by QA and the narrative/design team. This involves executing a test matrix covering all key MVE platform events for all 12 BunkerClasses and both primary ClassAffiliations (Loyal/Corrupt) to ensure high variety, deep contextual accuracy, and correct tone.
Bug Triage & Fixing:
o All bugs found are logged in the project's issue tracker.
o Conduct daily bug triage meetings.
o The goal is to achieve zero open P0/P1 bugs related to the MVE launch scope by the end of this task.
o All fixes must be accompanied by a regression test and be validated by QA.

Design Rationale
A dedicated hardening sprint under a strict feature freeze is the most effective way to transition a product from "feature-complete" to "launch-ready." It allows the entire team to focus on a single quality objective. Chaos engineering and long-duration soak tests are crucial for uncovering complex, systemic issues that are invisible in shorter test cycles.
Operational Considerations
This task is performed entirely within the local-first simulation. The results of the stability and data consistency tests are critical for building confidence in the system's readiness for a real-world cloud deployment. The list of fixed bugs and validated stability improvements will be a key input for the final Go/No-Go decisions in later phases.
Verification & Validation Criteria
QA formally signs off on the stability of the MVE and the success of the full regression testing.
The bug tracking metrics show zero open P0/P1 bugs for the MVE platform scope.
The narrative quality checklist is fully passed and signed off by the Narrative Designer.
The final stable build is successfully tagged in the repository.
Testing Methodologies
A combination of automated regression suites, long-duration automated load/soak tests, scripted and exploratory manual QA, and manual fault injection (chaos testing) within the local Docker Compose environment.
Version Control Strategy
Branching: A release/mve-0.9 branch is created at the start of this task to represent the feature freeze. Only hotfix/ branches containing P0/P1 bug fixes are merged into this branch.
Commits: The final Git commit for this task involves tagging the release/mve-0.9 branch with a stable version.
Security Audit & Compliance Checkpoints
The Security Lead will participate in the daily bug triage meetings to prioritize any security-related findings.
Any P0/P1 bug that has security implications must be reviewed and signed off by the Security Lead before being closed.
ReviewedBy: QA Lead, All Tech Leads, Lead Architect, Narrative Designer.
ReviewOutcome: MVE Stability Candidate Achieved (Zero P0/P1 MVE-scope bugs).
ValidationMethod: QA Sign-off on stability and regression testing. Bug tracking metrics show zero open P0/P1 bugs. Narrative quality checklist is fully passed and signed off.
