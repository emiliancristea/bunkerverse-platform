Context/Problem Statement
This is the ultimate internal gate. The MVE platform is feature-complete, polished, hardened, and all operational procedures are in place. Before we can commit to exposing the system to external testers in Phase 7, the entire internal team of stakeholders must conduct a final, exhaustive acceptance testing campaign on the production-candidate build. This campaign serves as a full dress rehearsal for the launch, validating the product, the infrastructure, and our operational readiness together as a single, cohesive unit.
Measurable Objectives
The complete suite of MVE E2E tests is successfully executed on the production-candidate build.
The platform is proven to be stable and performant under a final, full-scale concurrent user stress test.
A formal, minuted Go/No-Go decision for proceeding to external testing (Phase 7) is made and documented by all key stakeholders.
All P0 (Blocker) bugs discovered during this testing are fixed and validated.
Implementation Guidance
Action: Conduct the final, exhaustive internal acceptance testing campaign on the fully hardened, production-configured MVE deployed on the local Docker Compose simulation staging environment. This is the ultimate internal gate before deciding on readiness for external testing (Phase 7).
1. Test Procedures:
"Internal Full MVE Simulation": The QA team and all dev leads execute the complete suite of E2E tests from Phase 5 on the production-candidate builds.
"Day in the Life" Scenarios (All 12 Classes): Testers embody each BunkerClass, engaging with all relevant MVE features to verify the complete experience and narrative consistency.
Final Concurrent User Stress Testing: Re-run the MVE peak launch load stress tests on the fully polished staging environment to validate the final performance and stability.
Final Destructive Testing: Re-run key destructive test scenarios (killing the L3 sequencer container, the Indexer container, etc.) and validate recovery using the finalized DR procedures.
Security Control Validation: Actively test security controls (auth failures, input validation bypass attempts, etc.) as part of the E2E tests.
Monitoring & Alerting Validation: SRE/DevOps actively uses the production-mirrored monitoring on the staging environment to validate its effectiveness and ensure no critical alerts are missed during the tests.
2. Final Go/No-Go Decision:
o Based on the results, a formal Go/No-Go decision is made by all stakeholders for proceeding to external testing (Phase 7).
o Only P0 (Blocker) bugs found here are fixed. All others (P1 and below) are documented for the launch's Known Issues List and represent accepted risk.
3. Update docs/progress_logs/progress_phase_6.md:
o Log detailed plans and results for this final internal acceptance testing.
o Document performance under final MVE scale load.
o Record the formal Go/No-Go decision and its rationale.
Design Rationale
This final, comprehensive internal test is a full dress rehearsal for both the upcoming external test (Phase 7) and the public launch (Phase 8). It is the last chance for the core team to validate the complete system in a controlled environment. The formal Go/No-Go decision is a critical project management tool that ensures all stakeholders are aligned and formally accept the state of the product before it is shown to anyone outside the organization.
Operational Considerations
The "Known Issues List" generated from this task is a critical operational document. It will be used to prepare the community support team for the public launch and to set realistic expectations for external testers and early adopters. All testing is performed against the local Docker Compose simulation which serves as our production-equivalent staging environment.
Verification & Validation Criteria
All defined internal acceptance tests are completed successfully.
All discovered P0 bugs are resolved and validated.
A formal, documented stakeholder sign-off for commencing Phase 7 is achieved.
Testing Methodologies
A combination of automated E2E tests, scripted and exploratory manual QA, automated stress testing, and manual destructive testing, all performed on the complete, integrated MVE stack.
Version Control Strategy
Branching: Any P0 bug fixes will be done in hotfix/ branches and merged into the release/mve-0.9 branch.
Commits: The Git Commit message for this task will be exactly as specified.
Security Audit & Compliance Checkpoints
The Security Lead is a mandatory participant and signatory on the final Go/No-Go decision. Their vote represents the formal acceptance of the MVE's security posture for external testing.
ReviewedBy: QA Lead, SRE Lead, Lead Architect, All Tech Leads, Product Owner, Project Manager, Security Lead.
ReviewOutcome: MVE Internal Acceptance Testing Passed. Approved for External Closed Testing.
ValidationMethod: All defined internal acceptance tests are completed successfully. All P0 bugs are resolved. Stakeholder sign-off for commencing Phase 7 is documented.

Phase 6 Deliverable
(Security-Hardened Process-Hardened Foundation - MVE Production Ready, Internally Validated & Security Assessed)
Description
Upon completion of Phase 6, the MVE is a highly stable, polished, performance-tuned, and security-hardened system, as production-ready as internal efforts can make it.
1. Stable, Polished & Hardened MVE:
Description: All known P0 and P1 bugs related to the MVE platform scope are fixed. The client UI/UX is exceptionally refined. The entire system is stable under sustained load, as validated by long-duration soak tests and chaos engineering.
Acceptance Criteria: The project issue tracker shows zero open P0/P1 bugs. The final QA sign-off on stability and narrative quality is complete.
2. Production-Ready Client:
Description: Signed and (where applicable) notarized installers for all platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux) are built and validated. This includes a secure and robust Rust NAR model downloader with checksum verification. MVE-scope accessibility features are implemented.
Acceptance Criteria: Installers are successfully tested on clean VMs for all target OSes. The NAR model download and validation process is functional and secure. Accessibility checklist is passed.
3. Validated Performance & Scalability:
Description: The BUNKERVERSE Netchain (Arbitrum Orbit L3) and Rust Indexer are validated to handle the projected MVE launch load, meeting all defined performance targets (TPS, latency) with all security measures active. The Rust NAR is optimized for performance and resource usage on target hardware.
Acceptance Criteria: Final stress test results are documented and meet or exceed the performance targets defined in the project goals.
4. Operational Readiness:
Description: Comprehensive, production-grade monitoring, alerting, automated backups, and a fully drilled Disaster Recovery plan are implemented and validated. Finalized production-ready Infrastructure-as-Code (Terraform, Kubernetes manifests) and secure CI/CD deployment pipelines are ready for execution.
Acceptance Criteria: A successful E2E alert test has been completed. A successful DR drill has been completed and signed off, with RTO/RPO documented. The production IaC and CI/CD pipeline are finalized and approved.
5. Final Security Validation:
Description: A comprehensive internal security hardening pass and vulnerability assessment are complete. An incident response plan is finalized. The MVE is prepared for external security scrutiny.
Acceptance Criteria: All critical/high vulnerabilities from final internal scans are remediated. The Incident Response Plan v1.0 is approved. A briefing package for a potential external penetration test is complete.
6. Formal Internal Approval:
Description: The MVE has successfully passed all internal acceptance testing (functional, performance, stability, security) and has received a formal "Go" decision from all stakeholders to proceed to external testing.
Acceptance Criteria: The Go/No-Go decision for commencing Phase 7 is formally documented in the progress_phase_6.md log, with sign-offs from all required leads including QA and Security.
The project team has maximum confidence in the MVE's technical readiness, quality, security, and operational preparedness for external user validation in Phase 7.
