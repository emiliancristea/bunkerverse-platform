## First Principles Implementation Guide

### Daily Development Integration

Each of the 18 First Principles (A-R) must be actively considered in daily development:

#### Principle R: "Secure by Design" - Primary Focus

**Implementation Requirements**:
- Security considerations documented in every design decision
- Threat modeling completed before implementation begins
- Security trade-offs explicitly justified in Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
- Default-deny security model applied to all access controls
- Principle of least privilege enforced throughout system design

**PR Template Security Section**:
Every pull request must include a "Security Implications Assessed" section addressing:
- Potential attack vectors introduced or mitigated
- Data flow security analysis
- Access control changes and their implications
- Cryptographic operations and key management impacts
- Input validation and sanitization measures

#### Other First Principles Integration

**Decision-Making Process**:
1. **Identify Relevant Principles**: List all principles that apply to the change
2. **Document Trade-offs**: Explicitly state how each principle is addressed or why trade-offs were necessary
3. **Justify Decisions**: Provide clear rationale for any compromise on principle adherence
4. **Review Compliance**: Peer review must verify principle adherence

**ADR Requirements**:
- All significant architectural decisions must reference relevant First Principles
- Security implications must be explicitly analyzed for Principle R
- Trade-offs between principles must be documented and justified

## Mode Off-Chain First, Mode On-Chain Pre-Built Strategy

### Configuration Management

#### Feature Flags

**Primary Flags**:
- `enable_crypto`: Controls activation of blockchain/cryptographic features
- `show_crypto`: Controls UI visibility of crypto-related components

**Management Strategy**:
- **Cloud-Ready Build**: Secure secrets management solution for production
- **Local Development**: Secure local configuration files with version control exclusion
- **Propagation**: Consistent flag propagation through all system layers
- **Validation**: Runtime validation of flag consistency and security

#### Security Requirements

- **Access Control**: Restricted modification of production feature flags
- **Audit Trail**: All flag changes logged with timestamp and authorization
- **Rollback Capability**: Immediate ability to disable features in production
- **Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring of flag states and inconsistencies

### Schema Design

#### Protocol Buffer Guidelines

**On-Chain Field Inclusion**:
- Include fields necessary for future on-chain features (e.g., NTC staking status, crypto addresses, transaction hashes)
- Mark on-chain fields as optional in proto definitions
- Provide clear documentation indicating MVE vs. on-chain field usage
- Define default values for on-chain fields when `enable_crypto` is false

**Versioning Strategy**:
- Design for backward compatibility with MVE-only deployments
- Plan forward compatibility for on-chain feature activation
- Use proto field deprecation for smooth transitions

#### Internal Rust Structs

**Conditional Field Handling**:
- Use Option<T> for on-chain-specific fields
- Implement Default trait with MVE-appropriate defaults
- Document field usage context (MVE vs. on-chain)
- Provide compile-time validation where possible

### API Design (gRPC/OpenAPI/FFI)

#### Error Handling for Disabled Features

**gRPC Responses**:
- Return specific "FEATURE_NOT_ENABLED" status codes
- Provide clear error messages indicating feature availability
- Maintain API contract compatibility between modes

**HTTP API Responses**:
- Use appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 501 Not Implemented)
- Include structured error responses with feature availability information
- Document API behavior differences between modes

#### Extensibility Design

**API Contract Planning**:
- Design APIs to support on-chain features without breaking changes
- Use optional fields and backward-compatible extensions
- Plan for additional endpoints needed in on-chain mode
- Document API evolution path from MVE to full blockchain features

### Service Logic

#### Conditional Implementation Patterns

**Flag-Based Logic**:
```rust
// Example pattern for conditional feature logic
if config.enable_crypto {
    // On-chain feature implementation
    handle_crypto_operation(request)
} else {
    // MVE fallback or error response
    Err(FeatureDisabledError::Crypto)
}
```

**Service Architecture**:
- Clean separation between MVE and on-chain service logic
- Dependency injection for mode-specific implementations
- Clear interfaces for swappable components
- Runtime validation of service configuration consistency

### UI (QML) Integration

#### Conditional Rendering

**Component Visibility**:
- QML components check `show_crypto` flag for rendering decisions
- Graceful degradation when crypto features are hidden
- Consistent UI flow regardless of feature availability
- Accessibility maintained across both modes

**State Management**:
- Rust client application manages feature flag propagation to QML
- Reactive updates when flags change
- Clear separation of MVE vs. crypto UI state

### Testing Strategy

#### MVE Functionality Testing

**Core Feature Validation**:
- Comprehensive test coverage for all MVE features
- Integration testing with `enable_crypto` set to false
- Performance testing under MVE configuration
- User acceptance testing for MVE user flows

#### Disabled Feature Verification

**On-Chain Component Isolation**:
- Verify on-chain features remain completely disabled
- Test that disabled features don't affect MVE performance
- Validate proper error handling for disabled feature access
- Security testing to ensure disabled code paths are secure

#### Dual-Mode Testing

**Configuration Testing**:
- Test system behavior with various flag combinations
- Validate smooth transitions between modes (where applicable)
- Test edge cases and error conditions in both modes
- Performance impact analysis of dual-mode architecture
