# Incident Response Plan - Draft

This draft outlines the comprehensive incident response framework for the Bunkerverse Platform, covering both MVE (Minimum Viable Experience) operations and potential issues arising from pre-built on-chain components. This plan ensures rapid, coordinated response to security incidents, system failures, and operational disruptions.

## Executive Summary

The Bunkerverse Platform Incident Response Plan establishes clear procedures for identifying, containing, and resolving incidents that could impact system security, availability, or integrity. Special consideration is given to the dual-mode architecture, addressing incidents in both MVE-only operations and scenarios involving accidental activation or misconfiguration of on-chain components.
