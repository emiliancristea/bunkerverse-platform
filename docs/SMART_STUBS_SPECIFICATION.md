# Smart Stubs Specification

This document defines the standard contract for "smart stubs" used in Phase 0 development and testing of the Bunkerverse Platform. Smart stubs provide intelligent simulation capabilities for external services and components during development, testing, and integration phases.

## Overview

Smart stubs are sophisticated mock implementations that simulate real service behavior with configurable responses, latency, and error conditions. They are designed to support dual-mode testing (MVE vs. full blockchain features) and provide consistent, predictable behavior for development and testing scenarios.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. API Response Simulation

**Realistic Response Generation**:
- Generate responses that match production API schemas
- Support for both successful and error response scenarios
- Consistent data formatting and structure
- Proper HTTP status codes and gRPC status responses

**Data Consistency**:
- Maintain state across related API calls
- Support for complex object relationships
- Temporal consistency for time-sensitive operations
- Proper handling of CRUD operations

### 2. Configurable Latency and Errors

**Latency Simulation**:
- Configurable response delays (min, max, distribution)
- Network condition simulation (slow, fast, variable)
- Timeout scenario testing
- Performance testing support

**Error Injection**:
- Configurable error rates and types
- Specific error scenario triggering
- Network failure simulation
- Service unavailability scenarios

### 3. Stateful Behavior

**State Management**:
- Persistent state across stub restarts (optional)
- Session-based state isolation
- State reset capabilities
- State validation and consistency checks

## Standard Behavioral Interfaces

### Service Discovery Interface

```rust
trait SmartStub {
    fn get_service_info() -> ServiceInfo;
    fn health_check() -> HealthStatus;
    fn reset_state() -> Result<(), StubError>;
    fn get_configuration() -> StubConfiguration;
    fn set_configuration(config: StubConfiguration) -> Result<(), StubError>;
}
```

### Response Generation Interface

```rust
trait ResponseGenerator<TRequest, TResponse> {
    fn generate_response(request: TRequest, context: RequestContext) -> StubResponse<TResponse>;
    fn should_inject_error(request: TRequest, context: RequestContext) -> bool;
    fn calculate_latency(request: TRequest, context: RequestContext) -> Duration;
}
```

### State Management Interface

```rust
trait StateManager {
    fn get_state<T: DeserializeOwned>(key: &str) -> Option<T>;
    fn set_state<T: Serialize>(key: &str, value: &T) -> Result<(), StubError>;
    fn clear_state(key: &str) -> Result<(), StubError>;
    fn reset_all_state() -> Result<(), StubError>;
}
```

## Configuration Parameters

### Base Configuration

```toml
[stub.base]
name = "marketplace-service-stub"
version = "1.0.0"
port = 8081
enabled = true
```

### Dual-Mode Configuration

```toml
[stub.dual_mode]
enable_crypto = false  # Controls crypto feature availability
crypto_response_mode = "disabled"  # "disabled", "error", "mock"
```

**Crypto Response Behaviors**:

**`enable_crypto = false`**:
- `crypto_response_mode = "disabled"`: Return "FEATURE_NOT_ENABLED" errors
- `crypto_response_mode = "error"`: Return appropriate error codes/messages
- `crypto_response_mode = "mock"`: Return mock crypto responses for testing

**`enable_crypto = true`**:
- Full crypto functionality simulation
- Realistic blockchain interaction mocking
- Transaction simulation and state management

### Latency Configuration

```toml
[stub.latency]
min_response_time_ms = 10
max_response_time_ms = 500
distribution = "normal"  # "uniform", "normal", "exponential"
network_condition = "good"  # "good", "poor", "variable"
```

### Error Configuration

```toml
[stub.errors]
error_rate = 0.05  # 5% error rate
specific_errors = [
    { endpoint = "/api/users/{id}", status_code = 404, rate = 0.1 },
    { endpoint = "/api/transactions", status_code = 503, rate = 0.02 }
]
timeout_rate = 0.01  # 1% timeout rate
```

### Data Configuration

```toml
[stub.data]
dataset = "development"  # "minimal", "development", "stress_test"
persist_state = false
state_reset_interval = "24h"
```

## Dual-Mode Behavior Specification

### MVE Mode (`enable_crypto = false`)

**Cryptocurrency Features**:
- Wallet operations: Return "Feature not available" responses
- Transaction history: Return empty arrays or appropriate messages
- Staking operations: Return feature disabled errors
- Blockchain queries: Return not implemented errors

**Available Features**:
- User authentication and profiles
- Social features and messaging
- Content management
- Marketplace browsing (non-crypto items)
- Notification systems

### Full Feature Mode (`enable_crypto = true`)

**Cryptocurrency Features**:
- Wallet operations: Simulate wallet creation, balance queries
- Transaction history: Generate mock transaction data
- Staking operations: Simulate staking rewards and operations
- Blockchain queries: Return mock blockchain state

**Enhanced Features**:
- All MVE features plus crypto functionality
- NFT operations and marketplace
- Token economics simulation
- DeFi protocol interactions

## Expected Logging Output

### Structured JSON Logging
