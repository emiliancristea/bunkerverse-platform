# Monorepo Management Strategy

## Overview

The BUNKERVERSE Platform uses a unified monorepo approach to manage the complexity of a multi-language, multi-component system. This document outlines our chosen tools and strategies for dependency management, build orchestration, and development workflow.

## Architecture

### Language Ecosystems

- **Rust**: Managed via Cargo workspaces
- **C++**: Managed via CMake with cross-platform support
- **QML/JavaScript**: Integrated through Qt's qmake/CMake system
- **TypeScript/Node.js**: Package.json with pinned versions via .nvmrc

### Chosen Strategy: Hybrid Workspace Management

After evaluation, we have selected a hybrid approach that leverages each language's native tooling while providing unified top-level orchestration:

#### 1. Cargo Workspaces for Rust
- **Tool**: Native Cargo workspace with `resolver = "2"`
- **Scope**: All Rust components (services, libraries, contracts, client logic)
- **Benefits**: 
  - Shared dependency resolution and lock file
  - Unified testing with `cargo test --workspace`
  - Consistent toolchain via `rust-toolchain.toml`
  - Security auditing with `cargo audit` across all components

#### 2. CMake for C++ Components  
- **Tool**: Top-level CMakeLists.txt orchestrating C++ builds
- **Scope**: Shared C++ libraries, Qt client shell, UE5 components
- **Benefits**:
  - Cross-platform build support (Windows, Linux, macOS)
  - Integration with Qt's build system
  - UE5 project compatibility
  - Consistent compiler flags and security hardening

#### 3. Git Submodules for External Dependencies
- **Tool**: Git submodules with pinned commits
- **Scope**: llama.cpp integration, third-party C++ libraries
- **Benefits**:
  - Version consistency across development environments
  - Security through commit-level pinning
  - Isolation of external code changes

## Build Orchestration

### Development Build Sequence

1. **Environment Setup**: Validate toolchain versions via setup scripts
2. **Rust Build**: `cargo build --workspace` for all Rust components
3. **C++ Build**: CMake configuration and build for C++ components  
4. **QML Preparation**: Qt resource compilation and QML validation
5. **Integration**: Link Rust libraries with C++ shell via CXX-Qt

### Production Build Pipeline

1. **Security Scanning**: `cargo audit`, dependency vulnerability checks
2. **Code Quality**: Linting, formatting validation via pre-commit hooks
3. **Component Builds**: Parallel builds of independent components
4. **Integration Testing**: Cross-component validation
5. **Packaging**: Platform-specific artifacts (MSI for Windows, etc.)

## Development Workflow

### Repository Structure Benefits

- **Single Source of Truth**: All components versioned together
- **Atomic Changes**: Cross-component changes in single commits
- **Unified CI/CD**: Single pipeline for all components
- **Shared Tooling**: Common linting, security, and quality tools

### Drawbacks and Mitigations

| Challenge | Mitigation |
|-----------|------------|
| Large repository size | Git LFS for large assets, submodules for external deps |
| Build complexity | Incremental builds, component isolation |
| Merge conflicts | Clear ownership boundaries, feature branch strategy |
| CI/CD resource usage | Parallel builds, smart build caching |

## Tool Integration

### Pre-commit Hooks
- **Rust**: cargo fmt, clippy, cargo audit
- **C++**: clang-format, basic compilation validation  
- **General**: File size checks, secret scanning, line ending consistency

### IDE Support
- **VS Code**: Workspace configuration with Rust Analyzer, C++ extension
- **CLion**: CMake project integration with Rust plugin
- **Qt Creator**: QML development with CMake backend

## Future Scalability

As the project grows, we may consider:
- **Bazel**: For more complex build orchestration needs
- **Rush/Lerna**: If JavaScript/TypeScript components expand significantly
- **Component Splitting**: Extract independent services to separate repositories if needed

## Security Considerations

- **Dependency Isolation**: Each language ecosystem manages its own dependencies
- **Audit Coverage**: Comprehensive security scanning across all components
- **Pinned Versions**: All dependencies locked to specific, audited versions
- **Access Control**: Repository-level security for all components

## Validation

This strategy has been validated through:
- ✅ Successful `cargo check --workspace` build
- ✅ CMake project generation for C++ components
- ✅ Pre-commit hooks integration
- ✅ Git submodule integration (llama.cpp)
- ✅ Multi-language IDE workspace configuration
