# Testing Strategy

This document outlines the comprehensive testing methodology for the Bunkerverse Platform, covering all test types, tools, responsibilities, and environments across each development phase. Special emphasis is placed on testing both MVE (Minimum Viable Experience) features and verifying the disabled state of on-chain components.

## Test Types Overview

### Unit Testing

**Scope**: Individual functions, methods, and classes in isolation
**Tools**: 
- Rust: `cargo test` with standard test framework
- C++: Framework TBD (likely Google Test or Catch2)
**Responsibilities**: Developer who writes the code
**Environment**: Local development environment
**Coverage Target**: 90% line coverage for critical components, 80% for supporting code

**MVE-Specific Considerations**:
- Test all MVE features thoroughly with `enable_crypto: false`
- Verify proper error handling when crypto features are disabled
- Test default values and fallback behaviors

### Integration Testing

**Scope**: Component interactions, API contracts, service boundaries
**Tools**: 
- Custom test harnesses
- gRPC client/server testing
- Database integration testing
**Responsibilities**: Development team with designated integration test maintainer
**Environment**: Local integration environment mimicking production
**Coverage Target**: All critical user workflows and API endpoints

**Dual-Mode Testing**:
- Test service interactions with both `enable_crypto: true/false`
- Verify API contracts remain consistent across modes
- Test feature flag propagation through system layers

### End-to-End (E2E) Testing

**Scope**: Complete user workflows from UI to backend services
**Tools**: 
- QML/Qt UI testing framework
- Automated browser/application testing
- Full system deployment testing
**Responsibilities**: QA team with developer support
**Environment**: Staging environment identical to production
**Coverage Target**: All primary user workflows and critical paths

**MVE Workflow Testing**:
- Complete MVE user journeys without crypto features
- UI/UX testing with crypto components hidden (`show_crypto: false`)
- Performance testing under MVE configuration

### Performance Testing

**Scope**: System performance, scalability, resource usage
**Tools**: 
- Load testing frameworks (TBD)
- Profiling tools (perf, Instruments, custom)
- Memory leak detection
**Responsibilities**: Performance engineering team
**Environment**: Performance testing environment with production-like data
**Coverage Target**: All performance-critical paths and scalability limits

**Dual-Mode Performance**:
- Compare performance between MVE and full-feature modes
- Test impact of feature flags on system performance
- Memory usage analysis for disabled components

### Security Testing

#### Static Application Security Testing (SAST)

**Rust Components**:
- `cargo audit`: Dependency vulnerability scanning
- `clippy --W clippy::pedantic`: Enhanced linting for security issues
- Custom security lints for crypto operations

**C++ Components**:
- `cppcheck`: Static code analysis
- Compiler warnings with enhanced security flags
- Memory safety analysis tools

**Integration**: Automated in CI/CD pipeline with build failure on security issues

#### Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)

**API Security**:
- OWASP ZAP for API endpoint security testing
- Authentication and authorization testing
- Input validation and injection testing

**Application Security**:
- Runtime security testing of deployed applications
- Penetration testing of critical components
- Security regression testing

**Environment**: Dedicated security testing environment

#### Fuzz Testing

**FFI Boundaries**:
- `cargo-fuzz` for Rust FFI interfaces
- Custom harnesses for C++ integration points
- Memory safety testing at language boundaries

**Input Parsers**:
- Protocol buffer message parsing
- File format parsing (configuration, data files)
- Network input validation

**Coverage Target**: All external input processing and FFI boundaries

### User Acceptance Testing (UAT)

**Scope**: Business requirements validation, user experience verification
**Tools**: 
- Manual testing protocols
- User feedback collection systems
- Usability testing frameworks
**Responsibilities**: Product team with user representative participation
**Environment**: Production-like UAT environment
**Coverage Target**: All user-facing features and business workflows

**MVE-Specific UAT**:
- Validate MVE meets minimum viable user needs
- Test user experience without crypto features
- Verify intuitive feature discovery and usage

## Testing Methodologies

### MVE Feature Testing

**Comprehensive Coverage**:
1. **Functionality Verification**: All MVE features work correctly with crypto disabled
2. **Error Handling**: Proper responses when crypto features are accessed
3. **Data Integrity**: MVE data remains consistent and secure
4. **Performance**: MVE performs optimally without crypto overhead
5. **Security**: MVE security model functions independently

**Test Scenarios**:
- User registration and authentication (non-crypto)
- Profile management and social features
- Marketplace browsing and interaction
- Content creation and sharing
- Notification systems

### Disabled On-Chain Component Verification

**Isolation Testing**:
1. **Complete Disable Verification**: On-chain code paths are completely inactive
2. **No Interference**: Disabled components don't affect MVE performance
3. **Secure Boundaries**: Disabled code doesn't create security vulnerabilities
4. **Resource Usage**: Disabled components consume minimal resources
5. **Configuration Validation**: Feature flags properly control component states

**Test Scenarios**:
- Attempt to access disabled crypto APIs (should fail gracefully)
- Verify disabled components don't initialize or consume resources
- Test system startup/shutdown with crypto features disabled
- Validate error responses for disabled feature access
- Security testing of disabled code paths

### Dual-Mode Transition Testing

**Configuration Management**:
1. **Flag Consistency**: Feature flags are consistent across all system components
2. **Runtime Changes**: System handles feature flag changes appropriately
3. **Data Migration**: Data structures support both modes appropriately
4. **API Compatibility**: APIs remain functional across mode changes

**Test Scenarios** (Future Consideration):
- System behavior during feature flag transitions
- Data consistency during mode switches
- API response compatibility across modes
- UI state management during configuration changes
