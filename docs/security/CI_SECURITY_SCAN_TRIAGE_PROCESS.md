# CI/CD Security Scan Triage Process

## Overview

This document outlines the process for handling security findings from automated CI/CD security scans in the BunkerVerse Platform.

## Security Scanning Tools Integrated

### Rust Security Scanning

#### 1. cargo-audit
- **Purpose**: Scans Rust dependencies for known security vulnerabilities
- **Trigger**: Every push/PR to develop branch
- **Configuration**: Denies warnings for critical, high, unmaintained, unsound, and yanked crates
- **Location**: `.github/workflows/netchain-backend-ci.yml`, `.github/workflows/netchain-client-ci.yml`

#### 2. cargo-deny
- **Purpose**: License compliance and dependency policy enforcement
- **Configuration File**: `deny.toml`
- **Checks**:
  - License compliance (allows MIT, Apache-2.0, BSD variants)
  - Banned dependencies
  - Duplicate dependencies
  - Security advisories
- **Trigger**: Every push/PR to develop branch

### Container Security Scanning

#### 1. Trivy
- **Purpose**: Scans Docker containers for OS and application vulnerabilities
- **Severity Threshold**: CRITICAL, HIGH
- **Behavior**: Fails build on critical/high severity findings with available fixes
- **Coverage**: All Rust backend service containers (indexer, marketplace, identity, player_account, ai_data)
- **Integration**: Results uploaded to GitHub Security tab via SARIF

### C++ Security Scanning

#### 1. cppcheck
- **Purpose**: Static analysis for C++ code
- **Coverage**: Client C++ shell, Game server stubs
- **Checks**: All categories enabled including security-focused checks
- **Configuration**: Suppresses system includes, allows inline suppressions

#### 2. clang-tidy
- **Purpose**: Advanced C++ static analysis
- **Focus Areas**: Readability, performance, bug-prone patterns, security
- **Trigger**: Game server stub builds

## Triage Process

### Severity Classification

#### Critical/High Severity
- **Action**: Build fails immediately
- **Required Response**: Must be addressed before merge
- **Timeline**: Within 24 hours
- **Escalation**: Security Lead + relevant service owner

#### Medium Severity
- **Action**: Build continues with warning
- **Required Response**: Must be triaged within 1 week
- **Documentation**: Issue created in GitHub Issues
- **Assignment**: Service owner + Security Lead review

#### Low/Informational
- **Action**: Build continues
- **Required Response**: Review during next security review cycle
- **Documentation**: Log in security review notes

### Triage Workflow

1. **Initial Assessment**
   - Determine if finding is a true positive
   - Assess actual risk to BunkerVerse Platform
   - Check for available patches/mitigations

2. **Risk Acceptance Process**
   - Document business justification
   - Identify compensating controls
   - Set review date for re-evaluation
   - Obtain Security Lead approval

3. **Remediation Tracking**
   - Create GitHub Issue for accepted risks
   - Tag with `security`, `triage-accepted`, severity label
   - Assign to appropriate service owner
   - Set target remediation date

### False Positive Handling

1. **Suppression Configuration**
   - Add to appropriate configuration file (clippy.toml, cppcheck config)
   - Include justification comment
   - Document in security review log

2. **Tool Tuning**
   - Adjust thresholds if consistently producing false positives
   - Update configurations quarterly
   - Document changes in this file

## Phase 0 Initial Scan Results

### Rust Backend Services
- **cargo-audit**: 0 vulnerabilities found on initial stub code
- **cargo-deny**: License compliance verified - all dependencies use approved licenses
- **Clippy**: Configuration tuned to focus on correctness, suspicious patterns, and complexity
- **Trivia**: Container scans pending first Docker builds

### Client Components
- **Rust Components**: No security issues in stub implementations
- **C++ Components**: Directory structure prepared, awaiting implementation
- **Dependencies**: Qt and CXX-Qt integration planned, security review pending

### Game Server Stubs
- **Status**: Directory structure created for Phase 0
- **Security Scans**: Placeholder configuration in place
- **Future Work**: Full implementation and security scanning in post-MVE phases

## Configuration Files

- `deny.toml` - cargo-deny license and dependency policies
- `.clippy.toml` - Rust linting configuration optimized for game development
- `.clang-format` - C++ code style enforcement
- `libs/nar-rust-wrapper-for-llama-cpp/cbindgen.toml` - C FFI generation configuration

## Monitoring and Reporting

### CI Integration
- All scans integrated into GitHub Actions workflows
- Results visible in PR checks
- Security findings uploaded to GitHub Security tab
- Failed builds block merge to develop/main

### Regular Reviews
- Weekly security scan result review
- Monthly tool configuration review
- Quarterly security policy updates
- Annual tool effectiveness assessment

## Contact Information

- **Security Lead**: Review and approve risk acceptances
- **DevOps Lead**: CI/CD pipeline and tool configuration
- **Service Owners**: Remediation of findings in their components

## Document Updates

- Last Updated: Phase 0 Task 0.4 - Initial CI/CD Setup
- Next Review: Phase 0 Task 0.14 - Phase 0 Closure Review
- Review Frequency: Per task completion and quarterly
