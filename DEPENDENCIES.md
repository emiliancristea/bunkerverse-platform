**Template Column Definitions:**

- **Dependency Name**: Exact name of the dependency as used in package managers
- **Version (Pinned)**: Specific version number that is pinned in configuration
- **License (SPDX Identifier)**: Standardized license identifier (e.g., MIT, Apache-2.0, GPL-3.0)
- **Component(s) Using It**: Which parts of the system utilize this dependency
- **Justification for Use**: Clear explanation of why this dependency is necessary
- **Security Assessment Summary**: Date assessed, tool used, results, and any CVE links or audit reports
- **Approved By**: Name and role of the person who approved this dependency

## Instructions for Use

1. **Before adding any dependency**, create an entry in this table
2. **Security assessment** is mandatory for all dependencies
3. **Version pinning** is required to ensure reproducible builds
4. **Regular review** of all dependencies for updates and security patches
5. **Documentation** must be updated when dependencies are added, updated, or removed

## Approval Process

All dependency additions must follow the process outlined in `docs/PROJECT_GOVERNANCE_AND_WORKFLOWS.md` under the "Dependency Management Protocol" section.
